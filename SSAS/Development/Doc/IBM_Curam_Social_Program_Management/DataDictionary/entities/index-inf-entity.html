:</b>
<i> The runtime data for an activity in an enacted workflow.
</i>

<P>A new Activity Instance row is created for each execution of an activity in the enactment of a workflow <a href=ProcessDefinition.html>Process Definition</a>.</P>

<p><b>Example</b></p>
<P>

    You define a workflow (<a href=ProcessDefinition.html>Process Definition</a>) to allow correspondence to be sent to customers whenever their payment details change.  The activities defined in your workflow are:

      </P>

<UL>

<LI>system prints out a letter (automatic);</LI>

<LI><a href=Users.html>User</a> puts the letter in an envelope and posts it (manual); and</LI>

<LI>'End Process' (a necessary step to end the workflow which is mandated by the Process Definition Tool).</LI>

</UL> <P><a href=Person.html>Person</a> John Smith's payment details change due to an increase in rates.  This increase raises an event which causes the Workflow Engine to enact your workflow and create a <a href=ProcessInstance.html>Process Instance</a>.</P>

<P>The <a href=ProcessDefinition.html>Process Definition</a> specifies an initial activity ('system prints out a letter') and so the Workflow Engine creates an Activity Instance row for this initial activity and sets its startDateTime.  Because this activity is an automatic one, the Workflow Engine immediately calls the business processing defined by the activity.  Upon completion of the business processing, the Workflow Engine sets the endDateTime on the Activity Instance and marks it as completed.</P>

<P>The Workflow Engine follows the transition out of the 'system prints a letter' activity and determines that the next activity is 'User puts the letter in an envelope'.  The Workflow Engine creates another Activity Instance row for this next step in the workflow and sets its startDateTime.  Because this activity is a manual one, the Workflow Engine creates a <a href=Task.html>Task</a> for a <a href=Users.html>User</a> to perform the work.  <a href=Users.html>User</a> Ronan Rooney performs the work and upon completion he opens the correspondence screen and marks the letter as 'sent'.  Curam raises an event which causes the Workflow Engine to:</P>

<UL>

<LI>close the <a href=Task.html>Task</a>;</LI>

<LI>set the endDateTime on the Activity Instance and mark it as completed; and</LI>

<LI>follows the transition out of the 'User puts the letter in an envelope' activity.</LI>

</UL> <P>The Workflow Engine determines that the next activity is 'End Process', which performs the necessary clean up and ends the <a href=ProcessInstance.html>Process Instance</a>.</P>

<p><b>Technical Notes</b></p>
<P>There is no 'Activity' database table.  An activity is an XML element defined within the <a href=ProcessDefinition.html>Process Definition</a> metadata.</P>

<P>For 'sequential' workflows there will only be at most one active Activity Instance for any <a href=ProcessInstance.html>Process Instance</a>.  However, a <a href=ProcessDefinition.html>Process Definition</a> can specify concurrent paths and thus for such 'concurrent' workflows a <a href=ProcessInstance.html>Process Instance</a> may have multiple active Activity Instances.</P>

<P>For a workflow which contains no loops, there will be at most one Activity Instance for each activity defined in the <a href=ProcessDefinition.html>Process Definition</a>.  However, if the <a href=ProcessDefinition.html>Process Definition</a> makes use of loops, then there can be multiple Activity Instances for the same activity (one for each iteration round the loop); note though that at most one of these 'loop' Activity Instances will be active.</P>

<P>The Process Definition Tool (PDT) ensures that every <a href=ProcessDefinition.html>Process Definition</a> has an 'End Process' activity.</P>

:</b>
<i>Extension of <a href=ActivityInstance.html>Activity Instance</a> state data for Parallel Activity Instances - keeps track of which Workflow Data Object the Instance is processing.
</i>

<P>

A Parallel Activity in a Workflow <a href=ProcessDefinition.html> Process Definition</a> allows a workflow to perform the same step on multiple data items in parallel.  The data items are obtained from the Parallel List WDO and one <a href=ActivityInstance.html>Activity Instance</a> is created for each item in the list.  The Parallel Activity Occurrence record tracks which item in the list is associated with each Activity Instance.

</P>

<p><b>Example</b></p>
<P>

    Your department is experiencing a significant amount of claim fraud, where clients are boosting their eligibility by claiming to have more dependents than they actually do.  You define a workflow (<a href=ProcessDefinition.html>Process Definition</a>) to check the details for all dependents listed on claim forms.  The checks are time-consuming and you want to process claims quickly, so you simultaneously assign each dependent to an individual case worker for investigation (modeled as a Parallel Manual activity).

</P>

<P><a href=Person.html>Person</a> John Smith submits a claim form, indicating that he has three dependents.  This causes your workflow to be enacted, creating a <a href=ProcessInstance.html>Process Instance</a> and supplying the list of dependents as 'enactment data'.</P>

<P>The system transitions to the first Activity definition in your workflow.  The Workflow Engine detects that this is a Parallel Manual Activity and divides up the list of dependents - creating one Activity Instance for each dependent in the list.</P>

<P>It also creates a Parallel Activity Occurrence record for each Activity Instance, relating that instance to the dependent it will be processing.  Specifically, it records the position of that dependent in the supplied dependents list).</P>

<P>The Workflow Engine creates Tasks for each of the Activity Instances, separately allocating those Tasks to independent caseworkers.  The Workflow Engine uses the Parallel Activity Occurrence information to populate each Task with the correct details for the respective dependent.</P>

<i> An audit of the read or write of a C&uacute;ram database table.</i>
<P>C&uacute;ram supports the ability to record audit information about the invocation of any entity operation (both database reads and writes).  This mechanism is known as 'table-level auditing'.</P>

<LI>the fact that the transaction type was online;</LI>
<LI>the fact that the operation type was a read; and</LI>
<LI>the concernRoleID of John Smith (which was the selection criteria used to perform the read).</LI>
</UL>
<P><a href=Users.html>User</a> Ronan Rooney then changes John Smith's date of birth from 1st January 1970 to 31st December 1969, and clicks on a button to store the updated details on the <a href=Person.html>Person</a> table.  C&uacute;ram audits the Person.modify operation and stores:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the date and time of the operation;</LI>
<LI>Ronan Rooney's user name;</LI>

<P>C&uacute;ram allows a level of indirection when storing commonly-used values on the database.

<LI>You define a Code Table Hierarchy for Cities in your application in a file called CT_CitiesHierarchy.ctx.  This hierarchy has a top level Code Table 'Country' which in turn cascades to a 'City' Code Table.

The application server attempts to redeliver the JMS message a configurable number of times, after which it will forward the message to a Workflow Error Handler.</P>

<p><b>Example</b></p>
<P>

    You define a workflow (<a href=ProcessDefinition.html>Process Definition</a>) to allow correspondence to be sent to customers whenever their payment details change.  The activities defined in your workflow are:

<P>The <a href=ProcessDefinition.html>Process Definition</a> specifies an initial activity ('system prints out a letter') and so the Workflow Engine creates an <a href=ActivityInstance.html>Activity Instance</a> row for this initial activity.  Because this activity is an automatic one, the Workflow Engine asynchronously invokes the business processing defined by the activity by raising a JMS message.</P>

<P>The message is dequeued and the application server calls the business processing to print the letter.  The business processing attempts to invoke the Curam XML Server to format the letter, but because the Curam XML Server is offline, the business processing fails.</P>

<P>The application server detects the failure and invokes an error handler which:</P>

<UL>

<LI>creates a Failed Message to store details of the JMS message that could not be processed; and</LI>

<LI>creates an entry in the server logs.  The logs are configured to notify an operator that such a failure has occurred.</LI>

</UL> <P>The system operator can use the Administration Application to view all Failed Messages and take one of the following actions:</P>

<UL>

<LI>retry the message, e.g. after bringing the Curam XML Server online; or</LI>

<LI>discard the message, which will abort the workflow.</LI>

</UL>

<p><b>Technical Notes</b></p>
<P>The Workflow Engine is transactionally separate from the business application processing so that the Workflow Engine can take remedial action if business application processing fails.

    &nbsp;DEV: group 3, range 3<br />

    It?s also worth noting that the customer may need to assign multiple ranges to a system. For example, if at some point

    (far in the future), a particular key set on a system is nearing the end of the range of key blocks that have been

    assigned to the system, it will be necessary to assign it another range.<br />

    So, for example, the system DEV which had already been assigned the range group 65 / range 3 could be assigned another

    range group 65 / range 200 . Then, when a particular key set on the system has run out of key blocks from within group

    65 / range 3, Range Aware Key Server would simply start using key blocks in group 65/ range 200.

<i> A queued message for testing Curam workflows/deferred processes.

<P>From http://java.sun.com/jms: 'The Java Message Service (JMS) API is a messaging standard that allows application components... to create, send, receive, and read messages. It enables distributed communication that is loosely coupled, reliable, and asynchronous.'</P>

<P>'JMS Lite' is a light-weight implementation of JMS for Curam, specifically for supporting testing of Curam workflows and deferred processes.</P>

<P>JMS Lite uses this database table to provide a simple transactional queue.</P>

<p><b>Example</b></p>
<P>

    You define a workflow (<a href=ProcessDefinition.html>Process Definition</a>) to allow correspondence to be sent to customers whenever their payment details change.  

      </P>

<P>The payment business processing is a batch program that raises a 'payment increase' event whenever payments increase on a <a href=CaseHeader.html>case</a>.</P>

<P>You configure your workflow to start whenever the 'payment increase' event occurs.</P>

<P><a href=Person.html>Person</a> John Smith's payment details change due to an increase in rates.  When your batch program runs it detects John Smith's rate increase and raises a 'payment increase' event.  This event causes the Curam infrastructure to place a process enactment message on the JMS Lite 'queue' (i.e. create a row on this table) to enact the process.  The batch process is configured to convert any JMS Lite messages into 'real' JMS messages in the application server when the batch application processing has successfully completed.</P>

<P>The converted JMS message is delivered to the Workflow Engine in the application server, which enacts the workflow process.</P>

<p><b>Technical Notes</b></p>
<P>The JMS Lite implementation will be used automatically if your process runs outside an application server, e.g:</P>

<UL>

<LI>when you launch your server in the development environment, JMSLite will automatically detect the presence of the JMSLiteMessage row and will forward the message to the appropriate handler (e.g. to enact your workflow); or</LI>

<LI>when you run production batch programs that interact with workflow or deferred processing;</LI>

</UL>

<P>otherwise the JMS implementation provided by your application server will be used.</P>

<i> A count of the number of parallel branches remaining to be synchronized at an instance of a workflow join (synchronization point) in a <a href=ProcessInstance.html>Process Instance</a>.
</i>

<P>

      When a <a href=ProcessInstance.html>Process Instance</a> reaches a Parallel (AND) Split, it creates multiple threads of execution that must be synchronized at a corresponding Parallel (AND) Join.  The workflow engine creates a Join Instance row once it has determined the number of outbound transitions that can be followed out of the Parallel (AND) Split.  This row contains a count of the number of threads that must terminate before the Join Instance is satisfied and the engine can execute the activity associated with the join.

    </P>

<P>

      As each inbound thread on the join completes, it decrements the waitCount (the number of remaining threads).  When the waitCount reaches 0, the synchronization is complete and the engine executes the activity associated with the join.

    </P>

<p><b>Example</b></p>
<P>

    You define a workflow (<a href=ProcessDefinition.html>Process Definition</a>) to obtain vetting information about candidates for employment as teachers.  The activities defined in your workflow are:

<UL>

<LI>a police background check on the candidate; and</LI>

<LI>a references check with all referees listed on the candidate's resume.  This activity is not executed if the candidate has had no previous employment (e.g. a recent graduate).</LI>

</UL> <LI>a Parallel (AND) join that synchronizes the completion of the previous parallel activities; and</LI>

<LI>an activity that adds the candidate's name to the list of candidates eligible for interview.  This activity only executes if all previously executed checks passed.</LI>

</UL> <P>

      John Smith's applies for a job as a teacher in a local school.  An employee at the school board enters his application details into the system.  This triggers the enactment of your workflow and creates a <a href=ProcessInstance.html>Process Instance</a>.

    </P>

<P>

      The workflow engine executes the <a href=ProcessInstance.html>Process Instance</a>.  The first thing it encounters is the Parallel (AND) split.  It checks the two parallel activities for pre-conditions.  The first (police check) has no pre-condition, so it is added to the list of executable activities.  The second (resume check) has a pre-condition which evaluates 'true' (as John has worked in another school before).  The workflow engine creates two parallel threads for execution of the two activities.  It also creates a Join Instance record with a wait count of 2, to denote that the join should synchronize two threads.

    </P>

<P>

      The 'police check' activity completes (John has no record) and the workflow engine decrements the wait count on the Parallel (AND) Join; which becomes 1.  The 'resume check' activity completes (all references checked out OK) and the workflow engine decrements the wait count on the Parallel (AND) Join; which becomes 0.  The workflow engine detects that the Join is satisfied and executes the activity that adds the candidate's name to the list of candidates eligible for interview.

    </P>

<p><b>Technical Notes</b></p>
<P>At runtime, any arbitrary number of paths can be taken out of a Parallel (AND) split, from the number of available paths to 0.  The JoinInstance will reflect the number of paths taken, as long as it is greater than 0.  If no paths are taken, the workflow engine detects that the <a href=ProcessInstance.html>Process Instance</a> has stalled and creates a <a href=FailedMessage.html>Failed Message</a> for the attention of an administrator.</P>

<p><b>Example</b></p>

    You define a workflow (<a href=ProcessDefinition.html>Process Definition</a>) to allow correspondence to be sent to customers whenever their payment details change.

This increase raises an event which causes the Workflow Engine to enact your workflow and create a <a href=ProcessInstance.html>Process Instance</a>.

<P>The system transitions to the first activity definition in your workflow - printing a letter. This activity requires the 'Case ID' attribute as a parameter.  The Workflow Engine retrieves the Process Instance WDO Data record for the 'CorrespondenceDetails' Workflow Data Object and obtains the value of the 'Case ID' attribute from it.  It then passes this value to the business processing for the activity.  The business processing prints out a letter for the specified <a href=CaseHeader.html>case</a> (using the <a href=CaseHeader.html>case</a> to navigate to <a href=Person.html>Person</a> John Smith's financial and contact details).</P>

<P>The business processing returns a correspondence reference number which will be used to identify the printed letter.

<p><b>Example</b></p><P>You deploy some custom functionality in your production application.  After running for some days your users complain of a bug in your new functionality.  To obtain more information about this bug you require more verbose logging.</P>

:</b>
<i> An instance of a Reminder Notification for an <a href=ActivityInstance.html>Activity Instance</a>.
</i>

<P>The Process Definition Tool (PDT) allows you to define an arbitrary number of Reminder Notifications for any Workflow Activity that waits on an Event.  Any Activity that waits on an event can optionally specify a deadline after which the workflow engine should stop waiting and take some action. Reminders can then be set to send out notifications at specific times in advance of the deadline.</P>

<p><b>Example</b></p>
<P>

    You define a workflow (<a href=ProcessDefinition.html>Process Definition</a>) to ensure claimant records are kept up-to-date with government employment records.

</P>

<UL>

<LI> This workflow is triggered when government records show a claimant's employment details have changed (e.g. the claimant has been employed).</LI>

<LI> The workflow has a single Manual Activity which requests a Case Worker contact the claimant and confirm the change of employment status.  The Case Worker must do this before the end of the month.</LI>

<LI> A gentle reminder is set for two weeks prior to the deadline.</LI>

<LI> An urgent reminder is set for three days prior to the deadline.</LI>

</UL>

<P><a href=Person.html>Person</a> John Smith begins a new job, having been unemployed for some time.  John's new employment is picked up by a daily update from the tax system.  This causes your workflow to be enacted, creating a <a href=ProcessInstance.html>Process Instance</a>.</P>

<P>The system transitions to the first activity definition in your workflow - sending a Task to a Case Worker to confirm John's new employment details. The Task has a deadline 18 days away.</P>

<P>Two Reminder Notification records are created, corresponding to the two reminders specified in the Activity definition.</P>

<P>The Case Worker does not contact John for a few days.  Once the two-week point is passed (i.e. two weeks before the deadline), the Workflow Engine sends the gentle reminder. The Workflow Engine then deletes the corresponding Reminder Notification record.</P>

<P>The Case Worker waits until the day before the deadline to contact John.  Once the 3 day point is passed (i.e. three days before the deadline), the Workflow Engine sends the urgent reminder.  The Workflow Engine then deletes the corresponding Reminder Notification record.</P>

<P>The queue manager dequeues the request to determine eligibility for the case and invokes the Rules Engine.  The Rules Engine reads the row on this table to identify the rules which should be applied to the <a href=ProductDelivery.html>Product Delivery</a> case, retrieves evidence about the case (via Rules Loaders) and determines that the case is eligible and calculates payment rates for the case.</P>
<p><b>Technical Notes</b></p><P>The set of rules is encoded in XML and may be quite large.</P>
<P>Rule sets may change over time to accommodate changes in legislation; however, older versions of rule sets may need to remain in order to determine eligibility for old cases.  The management of which rule set applies to a <a href=CaseHeader.html>case</a> is held on <a href=ProductRulesLink.html>Product Rules Link</a>.</P>

<P>The Workflow Engine creates a <a href=Task.html>Task</a> whenever a manual activity is executed. At the time that the Task is created, the Workflow Engine takes a snapshot of any Workflow Data Object values that are used by the Task (for example, used in the Task Subject, or Primary Action).  This snapshot is stored as XML data in the wdoSnapshot attribute of the Task entity.  If the XML string exceeds 3900 characters, it is broken up into a sequence of strings, each with a maximum length of 3900 characters.  These strings are then stored as overflow records.</P>

<P>When the Workflow Engine attempts to reconstruct the Task's wdoSnapshot, it reads the wdoSnapshot from the Task record and appends any associated overflow records.</P>

<P>The Manual Activity maps data from several Workflow Data Objects to the Task.  The system captures these data values and snapshots them in an XML string.  The string is 8,000 characters long.  The system breaks this string up into two blocks of 3900 characters and one of 200 characters.  It persists the first block in the Task entity's wdoSnapshot attribute.  It then persists the second and third block as sequential overflow records.</P>

<P>The <a href=Users.html>User</a> to whom the Task was assigned opens their Inbox, which causes the Inbox to request the Task Subject from the Workflow infrastructure.

<P>During the life of a <a href=ProcessInstance.html>Process Instance</a>, data is stored in the attributes of workflow data objects. The value of these attributes can change at many points during the execution of the process. The attributes values can also be used at many points.  A Workflow Data Object Values History record is created any time an activity reads (or modifies) the value of a workflow data object attribute during the execution of a <a href=ProcessInstance.html>Process Instance</a>.  Hence the set of Workflow Data Object Values History rows for a given <a href=ProcessInstance.html>Process Instance</a> provide an audit trail of the <a href=ProcInstWDOData.html>Process Instance Data</a> for the life of that <a href=ProcessInstance.html>Process Instance</a>.</P>

<p><b>Example</b></p>
<P>

    You define a workflow (<a href=ProcessDefinition.html>Process Definition</a>) to allow correspondence to be sent to customers whenever their payment details change.  The activities defined in your workflow are:

      </P>

<UL>

<LI>system prints out a letter (automatic);</LI>

<LI><a href=Users.html>User</a> puts the letter in an envelope and posts it (manual); and</LI>

<LI>'End Process' (a necessary step to end the workflow which is mandated by the Process Definition Tool).</LI>

</UL>

<P><a href=Person.html>Person</a> John Smith's payment details change due to an increase in rates.  This increase raises an event which causes the Workflow Engine to enact your workflow and create a <a href=ProcessInstance.html>Process Instance</a>.

    </P>

<P>

      The initial activity in the process is 'system prints out a letter', so the Workflow Engine gets the necessary data for printing the letter (name, case, etc) from the attributes of the workflow data objects available to it. Before the activity is executed, the engine detects that an activity is about to use some <a href=ProcInstWDOData.html>Process Instance Data</a> and creates a Workflow Data Object Values History row to record the data values used.

    </P>

<P>

      The second activity in the process is 'User posts the letter'.  Once this has been done, the Workflow Engine updates another Workflow Data Object attribute with the time at which the letter the letter was posted.  The engine detects that an activity has changed some <a href=ProcInstWDOData.html>Process Instance Data</a> and creates a Workflow Data Object Values History row to record the change.

    </P>

<p><b>Technical Notes</b></p>
<P>

      The pool of workflow data objects can be quite large, so it would be inefficient to log the values of the entire data pool before and after every activity.   Hence the workflow engine ensures that only those workflow data object attributes that are either used (as input to) or modified (as output from) an activity are audited.

The XML infrastructure retrieves the corresponding <a href=XSLTemplateInst.html>XSL Template Instance</a> row and uses it to format John Smith's data into a printable document.  The XML infrastructure then prints this document and <a href=Users.html>User</a> Ronan Rooney puts the printed document into an envelope and mails it to John Smith.</P>
<P><a href=Users.html>User</a> Ronan Rooney then notices a typographical error in the XSL template.  He:</P>
<UL>
<LI>'checks out' the template; the XML infrastructure updates the row on this table to show that the template is checked out;</LI>
<LI>edits the XSL template to correct the typographical error; and</LI>
<LI>'checks in' his changes to the XSL template; the XML infrastructure creates a new row on <a href=XSLTemplateInst.html>XSL Template Instance</a> with the version number 2, and updates the row on XSL Template to show that the template is no longer checked out and that the latest version is 2.</LI>
</UL>
<P><a href=Users.html>User</a> Ronan Rooney uses your new functionality to format and print a letter to <a href=Person.html>Person</a> Mary Smith.  The XML infrastructure uses the latest version of the XSL template to format and print the letter (version 2, containing the correction to the typographical error).</P>
<p><b>Technical Notes</b></p><P>The version of a template that is edited is not always the latest one. Any previous version can be edited and (when it is checked-in it) will become the new 'latest version'.</P>
<P>New documents are always formatted using the latest version of the corresponding template.</P>
<P>Each row on this table stores an 'ID code' to permit the row to be identified by application logic and retrieved.</P>

<i> A version of an <a href=XSLTemplate.html>XSL Template</a> that can be used to format an XML document.</i>
<P>Most organizations have a requirement that (for legal reasons) correspondence from the organization must be reproducible in the original format with the original content intact.</P>
<P>Each XSL stylesheet/template may undergo a number of changes, e.g. to correct errors or conform to new requirements.  However, an old version of a stylesheet/template cannot be changed directly (as this would prevent the correct re-printing of documents formatted using that template) - instead a new version is created.</P>
<p><b>Example</b></p><P>You implement some new functionality that requires a new XSL template for printing correspondence to a <a href=Person.html>Person</a>.  <a href=Users.html>User</a> Ronan Rooney creates a new XSL template for this type of correspondence and uploads it.  A row is created on this table (with a version number of 1) to store the XSL template.</P>
<P><a href=Users.html>User</a> Ronan Rooney then uses your new functionality to format and print a letter to <a href=Person.html>Person</a> John Smith.  The C&uacute;ram Server retrieves data about John Smith and passes it to the XML infrastructure.</P>

Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to add existing places to a provider compartment. For example, Carry Smith informs resource manager that he wants to set-up the gender characteristics on bedrooms with bedroom 1, 2 and 3 being the 'Male Only' compartments and bedroom 4, 5 and 6 being the 'Female Only' compartments. In order to set up the gender characteristics, the resource manager creates each bedroom as child compartments within Carry's Day Care compartment and sets up gender characteristics as 'Males Only' for Bedroom 1, 2 and 3 and 'Females Only' for Bedroom 4, 5 and 6. He, then, adds 2 places to each Bedroom from the existing 12 places in Carry's Day Care compartment.

Help.PageDescription=This page allows the facility manager to update the provider roster line items and corresponding roster line items for a roster. CPM provides the facility to generate rosters, record client attendance, validate submitted rosters and pay providers based on attendance information. Providers can submit client attendance either through the provider self-service application or by submitting the completed paper roster sent by the organization. A roster line item allows an organization to record a client's receipt of a service from a provider for a period of time, such as a week or a month. Therefore a roster will usually have as many line items as the provider has clients for that period.

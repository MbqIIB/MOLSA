Help.PageDescription=This page allows the facility manager to view the details of an attendance roster and a list of associated roster line items. Rosters are used to record attendance information for a period for a client or group of clients. They can also be used by an organization or a provider to show the clients scheduled to receive services for an upcoming period. A roster line item allows an organization to record a client's receipt of a service from a provider for a period of time, such as a week or a month. Therefore a roster will usually have as many line items as the provider has clients for that period.

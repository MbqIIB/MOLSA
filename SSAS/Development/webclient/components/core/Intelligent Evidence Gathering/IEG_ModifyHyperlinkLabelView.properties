Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to modify a label. Each label has attributes specifying whether or not it is a hyperlink and the URL to use if it is a hyperlink. At script execution time, the hyperlink label appears as text (hyperlinked). Labels need not necessarily be associated with any particular data-entry field. Note that labels cannot be maintained independently of a question group.

Field.Label.Text.Help=Actual label text that will be displayed at script execution time. For example, "All questions are mandatory". Textual aspects of labels may include substitution expressions. The substitution expressions can reference RDO data items and questions previously encountered in the script. For example, if a question in a question group asks the user's name, the answer to this question can be used in the URL of a label included in a subsequent question group. 
Field.Label.ID=ID
Field.Label.ID.Help=ID of the label. This cannot be modified.

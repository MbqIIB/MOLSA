Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view the question script in a tree-view. On the left hand side of the tree window is the question script hierarchy. The question script name is at the top of the hierarchy; it consists of the question pages. Each question page can have a precondition and a question group. Question groups consist of questions and labels. On the right hand side of the tree window is the page for the selected item in the script. For example, if you select a question group, the View Question Group page for that question group is displayed.

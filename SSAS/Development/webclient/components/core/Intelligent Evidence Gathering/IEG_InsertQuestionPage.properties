Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create a question page for a script. A question page has two components: a question group and possibly a precondition. Thus pages consist of a set of logically related questions and labels with some logic controlling whether or not those questions and labels should be presented to the user. Question pages allow question groups to be reused between scripts. It is be possible to relate two pages in a parent-child manner. Pages structured as children of a common parent page will only be visible if their own precondition and those of all of its antecedents are met at script execution time.

ActionControl.Label.Save.Help=The Save action creates a new question page from the information entered on the page.
ActionControl.Label.Cancel=Cancel

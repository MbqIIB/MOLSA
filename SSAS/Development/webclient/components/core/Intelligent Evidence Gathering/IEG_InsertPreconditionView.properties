Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create a precondition for a question page. Preconditions are evaluated at script execution time to determine whether or not that question page should be presented to the user. If the precondition for a page is not met, none of that page's child pages will be considered as being part of that particular script execution. This means that for a page to be displayed its own precondition and those of all of its antecedents will have to be met at script execution time.

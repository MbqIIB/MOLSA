Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a user case approval. A user case approval check is a review of a case submitted for approval by a user. You will need to review the cases submitted for approval by some users more than other users, e.g., you would need to review the majority of cases submitted for approval by a user who is new to the organization, whereas, you would not need to review the majority of cases submitted by a user with more operational and business experience.

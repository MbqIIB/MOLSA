Help.PageDescription=This page allows a user to view a provider's service invoice request details. A provider enquiry is the first step towards associating a provider with the organization. A prospect provider inquires about offering services to the organization. This enquiry could be in response to a marketing campaign or an advertisement done by the organization. The prospect provider can place an enquiry directly by accessing the system externally, and registering to use the system as a guest user, or by contacting a resource manager. Following contact with the resource manager, the provider may choose to continue with the enquiry or close it.

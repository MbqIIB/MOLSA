Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to to select a plan item for which to record the client participation. Client participation can be tracked by recording the daily attendance, partial attendance, or non-attendance of a client related to a specific plan item. The time participated in a plan item can also be recorded. Attendance can be recorded for plan items that are in progress and for plan items which the client is responsible for. This allows the organization to measure whether or not the client is meeting his or her responsibilities and progressing towards the achievement of the plan item objectives.

      documents. Most document authors are familiar with text editors but
      maybe not with XML editors. Those who have experience writing HTML or
      XML documents with text editors may prefer to continue to use their
      favorite text editor. Many text editors also support syntax
      highlighting, automatic indentation, and other features that are
      XML-aware. These can help to make editing more productive.</p><p>XML editors are designed to recognize the structure of the XML
      document being edited and allow it to be manipulated more directly than
      with text editors. Many support the same plain text editing
      functionality of text editors, but most include a structured &ldquo;<span class="quote">tree
      view</span>&rdquo; and other interfaces. A few are even more specialized: they
      recognize DocBook XML as a special document format and support
      <span class="acronym">WYSIWYG</span> document editing.</p><div class="note"><table border="0" summary="Note: 
          WYSIWYG Editing"><tr><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="2" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="../images/note.gif"></td><th align="left"><a name="DMN120AB"></a>
          WYSIWYG Editing</th></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" colspan="2"><p>
          <span class="acronym">WYSIWYG</span> stands for &ldquo;<span class="quote">What you see is
        what you get,</span>&rdquo; a term used to describe editors that allow the
        user to edit a document on the computer screen in the same visual
        format that it will have when it is printed. This is typical of most
        modern word processor applications. However, as DocBook XML does not
        contain formatting information, such an editor displays the document
        as it might appear by applying various formatting styles to the
        elements. The editor could be customized to apply styles that are like
        those that the document rendering system will use, but as the
        rendering system may apply different styles and produce many different
        output formats, the term <span class="acronym">WYSIWYG</span> is probably better
        interpreted as, &ldquo;<span class="quote">It might look a little bit like
        this.</span>&rdquo;</p><p>For DocBook XML editing, a <span class="acronym">WYSIWYG</span> editor
        allows the author to get a quick impression of the structure and
        content of a document in a more natural representation, but there is a
        danger that it could also encourage too much focus on formatting.
        DocBook XML is not about formatting. There may be a tendency to use
        elements because of what they look like on the screen and not because
        they correctly identify the structure or content. For example, using
        <tt class="sgmltag-element">emphasis</tt> for menu items because it is shown in an
        italic font instead of using <tt class="sgmltag-element">guimenuitem</tt>, because
        the author does not like that the latter appears in a boldface font.
        You must remember that the appearance is that imposed by the editor,
        not the main rendering system. If the in-house style calls for menu
        items to appear in an italic font, then they will appear that way in
        the final output regardless of what style the
        <span class="acronym">WYSIWYG</span> editor applied during editing. When faced
        with a concern over the formatting of a document, ask yourself this,
        &ldquo;<span class="quote">What would this look like in an audio book?</span>&rdquo; The answer
        should give you the correct perspective: do not concern yourself with
        formatting. If the structure and content are correct, you have done
        your job well; DocMaker is then responsible for all of the
        formatting.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>Text editors have been around a long time and debate about which
      editor is &ldquo;<span class="quote">the best</span>&rdquo; has given rise to some infamous
      &ldquo;<span class="quote">religious</span>&rdquo; wars (the most
      famous&mdash;<span class="application">vi</span> vs.
      <span class="application">emacs</span>&mdash;has raged for nearly thirty
      years). If <span class="application">Microsoft Notepad</span> is the first
      thing that springs to mind when you think of a text editor, then a text
      editor may not be for you. <span class="application">Notepad</span> is poorly
      suited to editing DocBook XML documents because it lacks the features
      that make using a text editor for XML practical and productive. If you
      use a more advanced text editor, and know how to use it to the fullest,
      it may well be the ideal environment for you when editing DocBook XML
      documents.</p><p>XML editors are probably the best choice if you more familiar with
      <span class="acronym">WYSIWYG</span> environments and may have limited experience
      editing XML documents. There is still a learning curve involved as you
      try to come to grips with the document structure, but the fairly
      recognizable interface and the familiar appearance of the content will
      help you to get started. With experience, you will realize that the main
      impediment to productive editing of structured documents is a reliance
      on the mouse; the sooner you learn how to move around a document and
      manipulate the content using the keyboard the better. Although the
      document may look like any you have seen in a word processor, you are
      restricted by DocBook XML's structure and content rules when editing, so
      you will spend more time focusing on such aspects, and a lot more if you
      rely on the slow process of accessing menus and selecting options using
      the mouse.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="section_titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="DMN120F4"></a>Basic Requirements</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>Regardless of the editor you choose, there are a few basic

          <span class="acronym">ASCII</span> text, i.e., text that includes only
          unaccented letters, numerals, and basic punctuation, is not
          sufficient.</p></li><li><p>If the editor is an XML editor, it must not reformat the
          content of document elements that represent verbatim environments,
          i.e., elements, such as <tt class="sgmltag-element">programlisting</tt>, that
          contain significant white-space characters.</p></li></ul></div><p>Any editor that does not support these requirements cannot be

            DocBook XML and <span class="acronym">XHTML</span> editing. Of those
            evaluated, it has by far the best <span class="acronym">WYSIWYG</span>
            support for DocBook XML editing and is continually improving. Its
            features include table editing, context-sensitive element
            selection, customizable menus, a macro language,
            <span class="acronym">WYSIWYG</span> and tree views, spell-checking,
            automatic conversion of characters not in the declared character
            set into character entities, attribute editing, image insertion,
            and many more. It also assists in the development of documents
            that are split across several files. It reformats content
            consistently and correctly, so you can use it to do the
            reformatting for you and then switch to a text editor when making
            minor changes. The standard edition is free of charge. Make sure
            you use at least version 2.7. While C&uacute;ram does not support any

            recommended.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Eclipse XML Editor</span></dt><dd><p>The XML editor built into recent versions of

            editing, it does provide context-sensitive tag completion,
            automatic formatting, and validation features that make it a
            useful tool. For authors who use this environment regularly, this

    <tt class="sgmltag-element">book</tt> root element must be called
    <tt class="filename">book.xml</tt>. This is called the <i class="firstterm">book
    file</i>. You can create as many other files and folders within
    the book folder as you want, but only the book file will be processed by
    DocMaker. A book file must not be placed in a sub-folder of a book folder:
    it must be contained directly within the book folder. This restriction
    does not apply to other content files, such as those you might use for
    chapters and sections.</p><p>You can use <i class="firstterm">XML inclusions</i> to organize the
    content of a book into multiple files. These content files must conform to
    a simple naming pattern. <i class="firstterm">Chapter files</i> containing
    <tt class="sgmltag-element">chapter</tt> root elements should be named
    <tt class="filename">c_*.xml</tt>; <i class="firstterm">appendix files</i>
    containing <tt class="sgmltag-element">appendix</tt> root elements,
    <tt class="filename">a_*.xml</tt>; and <i class="firstterm">section files</i>
    containing <tt class="sgmltag-element">section</tt> root elements,
    <tt class="filename">s_*.xml</tt>. You can substitute any name for the
    &ldquo;<span class="quote">*</span>&rdquo; character in these patterns, but it is probably better
    not to use names like <tt class="filename">c_chapter-1.xml</tt> or
    <tt class="filename">s_section-3-7.xml</tt>, as the reorganization of content
    (simply by reorganizing the XML inclusions or by inserting new content)
    would make the numbered file names obsolete. A name like
    <tt class="filename">c_introduction.xml</tt> or
    <tt class="filename">s_configuration.xml</tt> might be a better choice, but you
    are free to use your own names once the prefix is used correctly.</p><p>An example of a book file that uses XML inclusions to include two
    chapter files is shown below.</p><div class="example"><a name="DMN10132"></a><pre class="programlisting">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE book

  &lt;xi:include href="c_main-topic.xml"

&lt;/book&gt;</pre><p class="title"><b>Example:&nbsp;Sample Book Using XML Inclusions</b></p></div><p>The example shows the correct <tt class="sgmltag-element">DOCTYPE</tt> declaration
    for a DocBook XML document. This should appear at the top of all book
    files. The <tt class="sgmltag-element">xi:include</tt> elements use the <tt class="sgmltag-attribute">href</tt> attribute to specify the location of the
    chapter files relative to the book file. In this example, they are located
    in the same book folder, so no path is required. They could, if desired,
    be located in sub-folders of the book folder. The namespace declaration on
    these elements is also required. The individual chapter files are written
    like in the example below and have a similar <tt class="sgmltag-element">DOCTYPE</tt>,
    but with a different root element specified. Note that without the
    <tt class="sgmltag-element">DOCTYPE</tt>, the files cannot be validated effectively for
    conformance with the DocBook XML standard.</p><div class="example"><a name="DMN1014F"></a><pre class="programlisting">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;

&lt;/chapter&gt;</pre><p class="title"><b>Example:&nbsp;Sample Chapter File</b></p></div><p>A chapter file, or other content file, must have a single root
    element or it will not be a well-formed XML file and will cause errors
    during processing. You can only have one <tt class="sgmltag-element">chapter</tt> root
    element in a chapter file, and likewise for appendices and
    sections.</p><div class="note"><table border="0" summary="Note: Support for XML Inclusions"><tr><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="2" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="../images/note.gif"></td><th align="left"><a name="DMN1015F"></a>Support for XML Inclusions</th></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" colspan="2"><p>XML inclusions can, in theory, allow book files to include chapter
      files and chapter files to include section files and section files to
      include section files that become sub-sections. However, there are
      limitations in the current version of the Apache Xerces parser used by
      DocMaker that cause XML inclusions to fail under certain circumstances.
      Limiting their use to including content directly with the relevant root
      element of the document and not using more than two levels of inclusions
      will avoid most of these limitations until improved support for XML
      inclusions in the Apache Xerces parser becomes available.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>If your document includes resource files such as images, these can
    be located in your book folder; in a sub-folder within your book folder;
    or even in another sub-folder of the document root folder, if they are
    shared between books. For the HTML Help output format, resources like
    images need to be distributed as separate files along with the HTML files.
    Therefore, DocMaker copies these resources to the relevant output folders,
    but does not copy DocBook XML content files, as you do not need (and
    probably do not want) to distribute these. DocMaker distinguishes between
    content files and resource files solely based on the naming convention
    described. If the file name does not match a book file name or other
    content file name pattern, the file is not copied.</p><p>The references you make to resource files should be specified
    relative to your <tt class="filename">book.xml</tt> file, not to the file that
    is referring to the resource. For example, if you create an image file
    <tt class="filename">C:\Books\UserManual\img1.gif</tt>, your reference to that
    image from <tt class="filename">C:\Books\UserManual\book.xml</tt> is just
    &ldquo;<span class="quote">
        <tt class="filename">img1.gif</tt>
      </span>&rdquo;. If you create
    <tt class="filename">C:\Books\UserManual\img\img2.gif</tt>, the reference will
    be &ldquo;<span class="quote">
        <tt class="filename">img/img2.gif</tt>
      </span>&rdquo;. However, if the
    content for a chapter is stored in
    <tt class="filename">C:\Books\UserManual\chap\c_intro.xml</tt> and it includes
    the latter image, the reference will also be
    &ldquo;<span class="quote">
        <tt class="filename">img/img2.gif</tt>
      </span>&rdquo;, <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
      &ldquo;<span class="quote">
        <tt class="filename">../img/img2.gif</tt>
      </span>&rdquo;, as it must be
    relative to the book file, not the chapter content file. If you create an
    image and want to share it between two books, you can copy it to
    <tt class="filename">C:\Books\UserManual\img\img3.gif</tt> and reference it as
    &ldquo;<span class="quote">
        <tt class="filename">../img/img3.gif</tt>
      </span>&rdquo;. The reason for this
    is that the XML inclusions are resolved before the resource references are
    resolved: all of the content files are combined into a single book file
    during processing and the references must be relative to that book
    file.</p><div class="note"><table border="0" summary="Note: File Separator Characters"><tr><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="2" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="../images/note.gif"></td><th align="left"><a name="DMN101AC"></a>File Separator Characters</th></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" colspan="2"><p>Although path names on your system (if you are using a Microsoft

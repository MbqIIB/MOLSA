    minor number, and patch number. These are changed under the following
    conditions (presented in reverse order):</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Patch Number</span></dt><dd><p>The patch number is incremented for releases that fix bugs,
          correct documentation errata, or address other minor issues. No
          patch release will ever require changes to existing DocBook XML
          content. The patch number is reset when the minor number is
          incremented.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Minor Number</span></dt><dd><p>The minor number is incremented for releases that introduce
          new functionality, make significant changes to the rendered output,
          or include significant changes to the DocMaker documentation. The
          same types of changes that are included in a patch release may also
          be covered under a minor release. No minor release will ever require
          changes to existing valid DocBook XML content; however, optional
          changes may be required to exploit some new functionality. Minor
          releases may also include new rules in the <tt class="option">check</tt>
          target, but these are likely to fail only for content that is
          already considered unacceptable or to enforce existing conventions
          that have not been enforced automatically thus far. The minor number
          is reset when the major number is incremented.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Major Number</span></dt><dd><p>The major number is incremented when a release requires
          existing valid DocBook XML content to be changed or when major
          changes to functionality or features are made that may impact the
          integration of DocMaker with other tools. Due to the nature of
          DocBook XML content, the former condition is unlikely to occur and
          every effort will be made to introduce new features in a
          backward-compatible manner. Should content changes be required, an
          upgrade tool will probably be provided. The latter condition is more
          likely, but its impact is generally confined to a small number of
          integration points where DocMaker is used within other build
          systems. In certain certain circumstances, a release that meets the
          conditions for a minor number increase may be released as a major
          release if the additional functionality is considered of major
          importance, even if it has no impact on existing content.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div><div class="footer"><p class="copyright">Licensed Materials - Property of IBM Corp, IBM Corporation and other(s) 1999,2012.

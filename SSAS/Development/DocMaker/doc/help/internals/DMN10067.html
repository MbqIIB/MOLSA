    writes a document. If the template includes paragraph and character
    styles, most of the formatting will be taken care of by the documentation
    software. However, the author must remain concerned about the appearance
    of the document as well as its content. If the document is required in a
    number of different formats (e.g., HTML, PDF, and paper), much work is
    required to convert from the original document into the new formats. An
    author who is not well versed in the use of the template and the styles,
    may produce a document that is difficult to convert into another format
    automatically.</p><p>For example, if a program is required to automatically convert a
    document from a word-processor format into HTML, it may be difficult to
    identify different heading levels if the author just changed the font size
    of some text to create a heading. If the output must be split into
    separate HTML pages for each section of the document, it may not be
    possible to identify what text is included in a section. Careful use of
    the template's paragraph styles makes this process easier, but most
    documentation software does not enforce the use of the styles and they may
    be used in unconventional ways by individual authors, thus further
    complicating matters.</p><p>Another problem with word-processor formats is that most are closed
    formats. Unless the word-processing software comes with the ability to
    export files to HTML format, it may not be possible to do any automatic
    conversion. If there is an export capability, it may not produce output in
    the required style and may not be configurable to change its default
    behavior.</p><p>The core of these all problems is that a conversion program can have
    great difficulty determining what the content of the original document
    <span class="emphasis"><em>means</em></span>. It can only guess at the meaning by examining
    what the document looks like.</p></div></div><div class="footer"><p class="copyright">Licensed Materials - Property of IBM Corp, IBM Corporation and other(s) 1999,2012.

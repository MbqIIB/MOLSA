        Before converting <span class="application">FrameMaker</span> documents
        to DocBook format, they must be checked, and probably edited, to
        ensure the success of the conversion process. If the documents are
        well prepared, the conversion process will be smoother and the
        DocBook output will require less modification.
      </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="section_titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="DMN130DF"></a>The C&uacute;ram Template and Formats</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
        Only documents that use the standard C&uacute;ram
        <span class="application">FrameMaker</span> template can be converted.
        The conversion process relies on the identification of the standard
        paragraph and character formats defined in the template to determine
        the structure and meaning of the text in the document. If these
        formats are used incorrectly, ambiguously, or in ways that deviate
        from their prescribed usage, the conversion process may fail.
      </p><p>
        Manual overrides of the predefined formats will not be preserved.
        For example, if the character format &ldquo;<span class="quote">Emphasis</span>&rdquo; is
        used, it will be converted to the DocBook <tt class="sgmltag-element">emphasis</tt>
        element, but if an override such as the direct application of an
        italic font was used, it will be lost. There is no way the
        conversion process can determine why italics was used; it may
        well not have been used for emphasis, so such an assumption would
        be invalid.
      </p><p>
        All manual overrides will be flagged in the output DocBook document.
        They can be identified within a <span class="application">FrameMaker</span>
        by placing the cursor in the paragraph or character sequence being
        checked and looking at the format name in the status bar in the lower
        left of the <span class="application">FrameMaker</span> window. The
        paragraph format name and, if applicable, the character format name
        will be displayed. If either format name has an asterisk character
        appended, this indicates a manual override. On some occasions
        (typically when a character format is applied to all of the text in
        a paragraph), it may be impossible to eliminate the flagging of a
        manual override on a paragraph format. These can be ignored.
      </p><p>
        To remove manual overrides on character sequences, select the text
        and set the character format to &ldquo;<span class="quote">Default &para; Font</span>&rdquo;
        to clear the overrides before applying the correct character formats.
      </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="section_titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="DMN13106"></a>Cross-References</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
        The conversion process attempts to identify and preserve all
        cross-references in the document, however, there are some
        limitations.
      </p><p>
        Chapter cross-references may be broken due to an anomaly in the
        use of the C&uacute;ram template whereby a cross-reference marker is
        created on a <span class="emphasis"><em>master</em></span> page instead of a
        <span class="emphasis"><em>body</em></span> page. These will need to be fixed
        manually before conversion.
      </p><p>
        Only some of the standard cross-reference formats (and even less
        of the non-standard ones) are supported. One problem is the use of
        cross-references that target another file. Many can be resolved
        automatically, but there are restrictions. The table below
        describes the supported cross-reference formats and when they
        should be used. It is likely that most of the cross-references
        in your document are compliant, but some may need to be changed.
        Some formats have several names (some are just misspellings); the
        supported alternatives are listed.
      </p><div class="table"><a name="DMN1311A"></a><table summary="Cross-Reference Formats" border="1"><colgroup><col width="40%"><col width="60%"></colgroup><thead><tr><th><p>Format Name</p></th><th><p>Description</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Chapter Reference</p></td><td><p>

                  references to chapters. Any type of reference to a

                  This is the preferred format for use when sections are
                  located in a different chapter or file.

                  appendices.

                  &ldquo;<span class="quote">Subsection</span>&rdquo; paragraph within an appendix.
                  This format was not included in the standard template,
                  however, for a cross-reference to a section in an appendix
                  from a location outside that appendix, this format should
                  be applied or the cross-reference may not be resolved.
                  You can import it from the conversion template described
                  below. An ordinary section reference may work, but the
                  probability is lower.
                </p><p>
                  The alternative &ldquo;<span class="quote">Appendix Section Reference</span>&rdquo;
                  is supported.

                  chapter or appendix. If this is used to reference a
                  section outside of the current chapter or appendix, it
                  is less likely to be resolved correctly.
                </p><p>
                  Many variations on the format name are acceptable:
                  &ldquo;<span class="quote">Heading &amp; Section</span>&rdquo;,
                  &ldquo;<span class="quote">Section &amp; Heading</span>&rdquo;,
                  &ldquo;<span class="quote">SectionAndTitleReference</span>&rdquo;,
                  &ldquo;<span class="quote">Subsection Reference</span>&rdquo;, and
                  &ldquo;<span class="quote">SubSection Reference</span>&rdquo;.
                </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Subsubection Reference</p></td><td><p>
                  The &ldquo;<span class="quote">Subsubsection Reference</span>&rdquo; format is
                  usually defined differently from the &ldquo;<span class="quote">Section
                  Reference</span>&rdquo;, as this section level is not numbered,
                  however, it will be treated like a standard section
                  reference during conversion and is acceptable once the
                  reference is within the same file. Again, when the
                  reference is to another file, the chance of it working
                  becomes slimmer.
                </p><p>
                  Long, made-up words seem to be hard to spell, so the
                  following variations have been identified and are
                  acceptable: &ldquo;<span class="quote">Subsubection Reference</span>&rdquo; and

                  even in the same chapter or appendix, cannot always be
                  resolved due to limitations in the conversion facilities

        None of the cross-reference formats that include page numbers are
        supported. These should be located and changed to one of the
        supported formats.
      </p><p>
        References within the same file are always resolved accurately for
        all but tables. References to other files (and local tables) are
        resolved by matching the title text stored in the reference to the
        title text of possible targets. If there are several targets with the
        same title text (e.g., &ldquo;<span class="quote">Introduction</span>&rdquo;, etc.), the
        references cannot be resolved. In this case, a warning is issued
        and the reference will have to be fixed by hand later. The special
        formats &ldquo;<span class="quote">Chapter &amp; Section Reference</span>&rdquo; and
        &ldquo;<span class="quote">Appendix &amp; Section Reference</span>&rdquo; improve the odds by
        narrowing the search for titles to the target chapter or appendix
        respectively.
      </p><p>
        When a cross-reference cannot be resolved due to ambiguities,
        DocMaker will replace the reference with a marker that can be
        easily identified. The format of an unresolved cross-reference
        marker is
        <tt class="literal">__dm_xref_<i class="replaceable"><tt>type</tt></i>__<i class="replaceable"><tt>target</tt></i>@@@</tt>, where <i class="replaceable"><tt>type</tt></i> is the
        type of reference, for example, <tt class="literal">table</tt>, or
        <tt class="literal">chapter_section</tt>, and
        <i class="replaceable"><tt>target</tt></i> is some information about the
        target such as the title text or paragraph number. Simply find
        these markers as fix them when the conversion process is complete.
      </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="section_titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="DMN13260"></a>Vocabulary Limitations</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
        The template used for C&uacute;ram documents does not have the rich
        <span class="emphasis"><em>vocabulary</em></span> of formats (or tags) that are
        available in DocBook. The resulting DocBook output will, therefore,
        need to be edited to &ldquo;<span class="quote">upgrade</span>&rdquo; the document to use
        the new vocabulary.
      </p><p>
        The &ldquo;<span class="quote">GUIElement</span>&rdquo; character format is used for all
        buttons, menus, labels, etc., but DocBook distinguishes between
        these objects. The conversion process applies the
        <tt class="sgmltag-element">interface</tt> element to all of them, but you should
        then modify your document and apply the <tt class="sgmltag-element">guibutton</tt>,
        <tt class="sgmltag-element">guimenu</tt>, <tt class="sgmltag-element">guilabel</tt>, etc.
        elements. For menus, this can include the use of the
        <tt class="sgmltag-element">menuchoice</tt> element that allows the effective
        definition of complex menu choices that include menus, sub-menus,
        and menu items.
      </p><p>
        The &ldquo;<span class="quote">CodeElement</span>&rdquo; character format is also widely used
        for many different objects such as class names, literal text, command
        names, source code fragments, etc. These are all marked as
        <tt class="sgmltag-element">literal</tt> elements in the converted output, but,
        again, <tt class="sgmltag-element">classname</tt>, <tt class="sgmltag-element">command</tt>,
        <tt class="sgmltag-element">sgmltag</tt>, etc. should be used instead and must
        be applied manually.
      </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="section_titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="DMN13296"></a>Other Issues</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>
        <span class="application">FrameMaker</span> documents include a dictionary
        of words that are allowed in the document. When converted, these
        words are lost. The DocBook document will need to be spell-checked
        and the allowable words added to the wordlist. As it is possible
        for the document dictionary to contain erroneous words that were
        added by accident, this presents an opportunity to review the
        spelling within all the documents.
      </p><p>
        Quotation marks are used directly in
        <span class="application">FrameMaker</span> documents, but the
        <tt class="sgmltag-element">quote</tt> element is used in DocBook instead. As an
        author types a quotation mark in <span class="application">FrameMaker</span>,
        it is converted to a &ldquo;<span class="quote">smart quote</span>&rdquo; by the application.
        These marks can cause problems when converting to different
        encodings and are very difficult to maintain when editing a
        DocBook document in a basic editor. The conversion process, however,
        cannot replace these quotation marks with the <tt class="sgmltag-element">quote</tt>
        element with any confidence, so the exercise should be performed
        manually after conversion. Where the double quotation marks appear
        within source code listings, they should be
        &ldquo;<span class="quote">straight double quotes</span>&rdquo;<sup>[<a href="#ftn.N126F9" name="N126F9">4</a>]</sup>
        to comply with the syntax of that language and should not be marked
        with the <tt class="sgmltag-element">quote</tt> element. If the template changes
        the style of the quotation mark used when rendering the
        <tt class="sgmltag-element">quote</tt> element, you do not want it to affect any
        source code examples.
      </p><p>
        Character, such as the &ldquo;<span class="quote">smart</span>&rdquo; quotation marks mentioned
        above, that are not within the <span class="acronym">ISO</span>
        &ldquo;<span class="quote">Latin 1</span>&rdquo; character set, appear as numeric character
        entities. For example, an em-dash appears as
        <tt class="sgmltag-genentity">&amp;#8212;</tt>. These can be difficult
        to decipher, so you can convert these into named character entities
        by editing the file using a suitable <span class="acronym">XML</span> editor
        such as <span class="application">XXE</span> and then saving it. In the
        case of the em-dash, it will now appear as
        <tt class="sgmltag-genentity">&amp;mdash;</tt>. This procedure is not
        mandatory, and while it makes the file more readable, the biggest
        culprits are the &ldquo;<span class="quote">smart</span>&rdquo; quotes that should be replaced
        with a <tt class="sgmltag-element">quote</tt> element instead of character entities.
      </p><p>
        DocBook has no inherent concept of formatting beyond the expectation
        that whitespace in the content of certain elements (such as
        <tt class="sgmltag-element">programlisting</tt> elements) should be preserved
        during rendering. This means that there is no way to specify an
        indented paragraph, something commonly used in C&uacute;ram documents
        by applying the &ldquo;<span class="quote">Indent</span>&rdquo; paragraph format. DocMaker
        will indent paragraphs as appropriate when rendering DocBook
        documents, but there is no one element in DocBook that can be
        applied to all indented paragraphs without the potential for
        identifying content incorrectly. For example, paragraphs within
        the same <tt class="sgmltag-element">listitem</tt> element are indented to the
        same level by DocMaker, something that has to be manually arranged
        using different formats in <span class="application">FrameMaker</span>.
        However, isolated indented paragraphs may be intended as short
        code samples, ad hoc lists, user input, etc. and these require
        the application of very different DocBook elements. These can only
        be resolved manually.

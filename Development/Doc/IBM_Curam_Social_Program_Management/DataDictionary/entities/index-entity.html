<p>

Conditional logic can be used to filter data such that it does not appear to a user, for example, recommended activities displayed in an outcome plan can be filtered such that only particular recommendations are displayed if configured conditions are met. A condition can be based on gender, age, a rule set, a factor score or a factor classification. Conditions can be grouped together into sets, for example, a condition set can contain a condition for gender and for age. This entiy stores the link between the admin configuration of an Outcome Plan Activity and a <a href=ConditionData.html>condition</a> or <a href=ConditionSet.html>condition set</a>.

</p> 



<p><b>Example</b></p>
<p>

An <a href=OutcomePlan.html>outcome plan</a> is created for <a href=CaseParticipantRole.html>James Smith</a>, <a href=CaseParticipantRole.html>Linda Smith</a> and their child <a href=CaseParticipantRole.html>Robert</a> to identify and address their issues. James Smith is classified as having a Need in Substance Abuse. Adolescent Substance Abuse Treatment and Adult Inpatient Substance Abuse Treatment have been configured as recommendations for clients classified as having a Need in Substance Abuse. A condition has been associated with Adolescent Substance Abuse Treatment such that it is only recommended if the client is between the ages of 16 and 18. A condition set has been associated with Adult Inpatient Substance Abuse Treatment such that it is only recommended to male clients over the age of 18. Based on this condition, Adult Inpatient Substance Abuse Treatment is recommended for James as he is over the age of 18 and is a male. This entity stores the link between the configured Adolescent Substance Abuse Treatment activity and the <a href=ConditionSet.html>condition set</a>.

Optimistic locking is not required for this entity as the only modify operation allowed is cancel, which has it's own validations.

<P>Many concurrent addresses can be stored for a <a href=Concern.html>participant</a> but one address is marked as the primary or default address. A type e.g. home, work, etc. can be recorded for each address.</P>
<p><b>Example</b></p><P>John Smith is a registered <a href=Person.html>person</a> in Curam. Two address records are stored for John; his home address and his business address.</P>
<p><b>Technical Notes</b></p><P>Many types of Curam entities can have a related address; logically these entities have an 'address' attribute which is a 'complex data type'.  Physically however each of these entities has an address attribute which relates to a row on the address table.</P>
<P>
        Addresses may vary over time (e.g. a <a href=Concern.html>participant</a> may move house or notify the organization of a typographical error in the address).  Most organizations have a legal requirement to keep an exact record (including any typographical errors) of an address to which correspondence or payment has been sent.  To support this requirement, Curam has the ability to 'clone' an address record and mark the clone as non-modifiable.  Typically Curam financial and correspondence functionality stores references to these non-modifiable clone addresses.</P>
<P>The storage format for address data is as follows:</P>
<UL>

The creation date and created by fields should be populated by the system using the current program user and current date on creation of a new agreement.

The creation date and created by fields should be populated by the system using the current program user and current date on creation of a new agreement.

An agreement can only be issued once it has been completed.

An agreement can only be signed once it has been completed or issued.

An agreement can only be reissued if it has been issued.

When reissuing an agreement, a reason must be specified.

If an activity exists on an agreement, the activity cannot be cancelled until the activity is removed from the agreement or the agreement is cancelled.

It is not permitted to remove a client from an activity if the activity exists as part of an agreement. To achieve this one must either remove the client/activity from the agreement or cancel the agreement.

A client cannot be removed where an activity exists for that client on the agreement and no other agreement clients exist on the activity. The user must first remove the activity before they can remove the client.

It is possible to cancel an agreement at any stage during its lifecycle, and no constraints exist surrounding the cancellation of an agreement.

Each object has a ?type? entry. For example, if a denied program application is being appealed, an entry will be added to the appeal object of type ?Program Application?. 



The implementation of appeals in the application allows for a one to one relationship between an AppealRelationship and AppealObject record. This is to allow Users to decide on each object under appeal separately. For example, an application for Income Support contains two programs ? Cash Assistance and Food Assistance.  Both programs are denied. The customer submits an appeal because they disagree with the grounds for denial.  Two AppealRelationship records are created under the Appeal ? one linked to the Cash Assistance program application AppealObject and one linked to the Food Assistance AppealObject.

This entity is focused on the administration of approval criteria within the Service Planning Administration component. An approval  criteria can be associated with one or more <a href=PlanItem.html>plan items</a>. Pre-approval criteria define the events that must be completed before a planned item can be approved and post-approval criteria define the events that will occur after the planned item is approved.

<p><b>Example</b></p>
A case worker creates a Back to Work service plan for participant Linda Smith as she has recently become unemployed. A Gain Sustainable Employment goal is selected for this service plan. Linda requires assistance with child care, therefore a Childcare sub-goal is added to the service plan. 

The Childcare Provision planned item is added to the service plan to achieve the service plan sub-goal. The approval criteria that has been configured for the plan item in the Administration component is added to the planned item.

The plan item is submitted for approval. Prior to approval of the planned item, the system verifies that the expected cost of the child care service does not exceed a particular amount and the planned item is approved because the pre-approval criteria has been satisfied.

The following has been set up in the Administration component to achieve this: 

An administrator creates a Back to Work service plan. 

A Gain Sustainable Employment goal is then added. 

A Childcare sub-goal is linked to the goal, and a Childcare Provision plan item is linked to the Childcare sub-goal. 

An approval criteria of type pre-approval is created to define the conditions that must be satisfied prior to approval.

The approval criteria is associated with the Childcare Provision plan item.

<i>A type of assessment which can be used to assess a client across a set of defined <a href=Factor.html>factors</a>.


</i>

<p>

An assessment is used to identify a clients needs and enable the development of a <a href=OutcomePlan.html>outcome plan</a> whereby the most

appropriate activities may be scheduled to address any needs identified. An agency may have many different types of assessments, for example, Risk Assessment, Safety Assessment, Self Sufficiency Assessment. 

This entity is focused on the definition of different types of assessment within the administration component. An assessment can be run for a group of clients which results in one result for the group or it may be run for one or more clients producing results for each client. A user must specify whether an assessment is group based or individual client based when creating an assessment definition.

An assessment may be executed using <a href=DAAssessmentConfiguration.html>Cúram Decision Assist (CDA)</a> or <a href=CERTSpecification.html>Cúram Express Rules (CER)</a>, this must be defined when creating an assessment definition. 

</p> 





<p><b>Example</b></p>




James Smith, Linda Smith and their child Robert must be assessed to identify the family's strengths and needs in an effort to help build an effective outcome plan.  The <a href=AssessmentDefinition.html>Family Strengths and Needs Assessment (FSN)</a> is run from the family's <a href=OutcomePlan.html>outcome plan</a> by a <a href=Users.html>case worker</a>.

This entity holds the service delivery related details of any service plan item(s) present on a service plan at the time the baseline was created.

A case worker creates a Return to Work service plan for participant Linda Smith as she has recently become unemployed. A Gain Sustainable Employment goal is selected for this service plan. Linda Smith is unable to work because she must stay at home to care for her children. A Childcare sub-goal is created to meet Linda's need for child care services. A Child Care service plan item is added to the service plan to authorize Linda to receive 4 hours of child care services on Tuesday and Thursday of each week.

The service plan is submitted for approval and a submission baseline is created. The baseline plan item entity stores the service delivery related details, e.g. the child care service authorized and the provider authorized to provide the service, of the plan item present on the service plan at the time the baseline is created.

<p>

An <a href=AssessmentDefinition.html>assessment</a> may be executed using Cúram Decision Assist (CDA) or Cúram Express Rules (CER). If CER is used this entity stores the details of the CER rule set and details of the IEG script used to gather assessment answers.  For example, a <a href=AssessmentDefinition.html>Family Strength and Needs Assessment</a> uses CDA to produce results whereas a <a href=AssessmentDefinition.html>Risk Assessment</a> uses CER to produce results as the assessment contains more complex processing.

This entity is used to store a history of guidance text specified for <a href=FactorClassification.html>factor classifications</a>.

</p> 





<p><b>Example</b></p>


<p>

An administrator creates a <a href=AssessmentDefinition.html>Family Strength and Needs Assessment</a>. A <a href=FactorCategory.html>category</a> of Need is defined for this       <a href=AssessmentDefinition.html>assessment</a>. <a href=CategoryClassification.html>Classifications</a> of Need and Strength are specified for this category. Nine <a href=Factor.html>factors</a> are defined for the <a href=AssessmentDefinition.html>FSN</a> and are categorized as Need and will therefore be classified using the classifications Need and Strength. Ranges are defined for each <a href=FactorClassification.html>factor classification</a>, for example, Substance Abuse/Use is classified using Need (-5 to -1) and Strength (0 - 5). Guidance is added for these classifications to assist a case worker dealing with clients who achieve results which fall into these classifications.    

    

This entity stores the guidance added to the Need (-5 to -1) and Strength (0 - 5) <a href=FactorClassification.html>factor classifications</a> for Substance Abuse/Use and any subsequent updates to that guidance.

<i>Stores the configuration required to use the Cúram Data Mapping Engine to map from one Data Store to Another.

A feature of the Cúram Data Mapping Engine is that it allows mapping from one Data Store to another Data Store. To use this functionality it is necessary to configure the Mapping Engine so that it knows about the structure (i.e. schema) of the source and target Data Stores.

<p><b>Example</b></p>James Smith has completed an online screening using Citizen Self Service. He now wishes to complete an online application. The screening that James completed and the application that he plans to complete do not use the same Data Store schema. Using a common Data Store schema (the recommended approach) between Screening and Intake would mean that this mapping is not required. To avoid James being forced to answer the same questions in the application the system maps any common data from the screening Data Store to the application Data Store using the Cúram Data Mapping Engine. This entity is used to configure this mapping process.

<i> DerivedCompCharacteristic contains the characteristic information of a compartment, which is implicitly derived based on the current occupant.
</i>

When an implicitly derived characteristic is added to a compartment by a Resource Manager, a record is created at that point in the Characteristic table only, for the relevant the characteristic category, e.g. Gender, Religion. This record will have an Apply Type to indicate the desired behavior when a second client is to be placed in the compartment.

When a client is placed into an empty compartment with such a record associated with it, a record is at that point created in the DerivedCompartmentCharacteristic table. This record will store the value for the client of the relevant characteristic category. For example, if the category for the compartment is Gender, and the client being placed is male, then a record will be created with a characteristic code of Male.

This design facilitates searching of suitable compartments by physically storing a record corresponding to an implicitly derived characteristic.  It will be necessary for the record in the DerivedCompCharacteristic table to be removed when the last placement in the compartment ends.

While data model support is provided for characteristics to be derived based on Reservations, there is no recommended best practice at this stage to implement them, as the requirements around deriving characteristics based on Reservations haven?t been fully analysed.

<i> A relationship between two separate evidence types. 
  </i>
<P> The evidence relationship entity manages relationships between business entities. These relationships are normally referred to as parent child relationships and can exist for a number of reasons. One such reason is where the parent is the main business entity and the child provides further details, the further details being separated into a separate entity because there's potentially more than one occurrence. For example income and income usage has a parent child relationship as the income usage provides more information about income evidence and there may be more than one usage of income at any one point in time.</P>
<P>
  Another reason for a relationship between two evidence types is where one aspect of the evidence is optional and this information may also be used elsewhere in a different context i.e. with a different business entity. For example a <a href=ConcernRole.html>client</a> takes out a loan, the loan may be used for property repairs and therefore a relationship is created between the loan and the property. However the property could exist for the <a href=ConcernRole.html>client</a> anyway and there may never be a loan associated with it.

<i>A domain or dimension which can be used to assess a client e.g. Substance Abuse.


</i>

<p>

A factor can be assessed as part of an <a href=AssessmentDefinition.html>assessment</a> with other factors or it can be used in a standalone manner.

</p> 





<p><b>Example</b></p>
<p>

James Smith, Linda Smith and their child Robert must be assessed to identify the family's strengths and needs in an effort to help build an effective outcome plan.  The <a href=AssessmentDefinition.html>Family Strengths and Needs Assessment (FSN) Assessment</a> is run from the family's <a href=OutcomePlan.html>outcome plan</a> by a <a href=Users.html>case worker</a>. Linda is selected as Roberts <a href=AssessmentDeliveryRole.html>primary caregiver</a>, James is his <a href=AssessmentDeliveryRole.html>secondary caregiver</a> and Robert is selected as the <a href=AssessmentDeliveryRole.html>focus child</a>. The <a href=Assessment.html>Definition FSN</a> contains nine <a href=Factor.html>factors</a> which are used to assess the family's functioning and a <a href=FactorResult.html>result</a> is produced for each <a href=FactorDelivery.html>factor</a>.

<i>The categories that can be used to categorize a <a href=Factor.html>factor</a>, for example, Need and Barrier.






</i>

<p>Categories can have associated <a href=CategoryClassification.html>category classifications</a>, for example a category of Need can have <a href=CategoryClassification.html>classifications</a> of Need and Strength. Associating <a href=CategoryClassification.html>category classifications</a> with categories means that these <a href=CategoryClassification.html>classifications</a> can be reused across multiple <a href=Factor.html>factors</a> which are categorized in the same way.

One or more categories can be specified for an <a href=AssessmentDefinition.html>assessment definition</a>. An <a href=AssessmentDefinition.html>assessment</a> is made up of one or more <a href=Factor.html>factors</a>. The <a href=Factor.html>factors</a> are categorized in order to determine the applicable classifications for the factors within the assessment. For example, a category of Barrier may be classified using classifications of Dependent, Progressing, Independent whereas a category of Need may be classified using classifications of  In Crisis, At Risk, Safe, Stable, Thriving. Any factor categorized as a Need will use the classifications of In Crisis, At Risk, Safe, Stable, Thriving. Any factor categorized as Barrier will use the classifications of Dependent, Progressing, Independent.   

    

</p> 





<p><b>Example</b></p>


<p>

      

An administrator creates a <a href=AssessmentDefinition.html>Family Strength and Needs Assessment(FSN)</a>. A <a href=FactorCategory.html>category</a> of Need is defined for this assessment. Classifications of Need and Strength are specified for this <a href=FactorCategory.html>category</a>. Nine <a href=Factor.html>factors</a> are defined for the <a href=AssessmentDefinition.html>FSN assessment</a> and are categorized as Need and will therefore be classified using the classifications Need and Strength.

This entity stores the category of Need which is used to categorize the <a href=Factor.html>factors</a> in the <a href=AssessmentDefinition.html>assessment</a>.

      



</p>



<p><b>Technical Notes</b></p>
A category is mandatory when creating a factor so when a user defined factor is added to an outcome plan delivery a record must be created on this table.

<i>A measurement indicator of a clients progress for a <a href=Factor.html>factor</a>.




</i>

<p>

A factor classification can be either a classification or classification subdivision. A classification is a portion of the scale that measures the actual progress of a client e.g. Need 0-5. A subdivision defines a portion of the range entered on the classification enabling a finer level of measurement e.g. a value of  1.

</p>

The printable document for an outcome plan contains a number of chapters, including goals and factors.  The user has the option to select the content items from a list of available items for this outcome plan to include in the printable document.

The user does not want to include goals in the printable document, so does not select to include this content item when generating a printable document for an outcome plan. The next time the user generates a printable document for an outcome plan of the same type, goals will not be preselected.

Under Substance Abuse, the system shall present Activity 1 as a recent item. Activity 1 is not currently recommended but it was added for another client with the same rating for the Substance Abuse Factor. Under Education, the system shall not present any recent items, because no items have been added for other clients rated Medium in the education factor.

The printable document contains a table of contents and chapters to represent the main functional components of an outcome plan.

A social welfare agency has a Back-to-Work outcome plan type where objectives are not applicable and therefore should not form part of the printable document.

This allows for civilities to be recommended on a case without running an assessment i.e. they are recommended on case creation.

<p>

Conditional logic can be used to filter data such that it does not appear to a user, for example, recommended activities displayed in an outcome plan can be filtered such that only particular recommendations are displayed if configured conditions are met. A condition can be based on gender, age, a rule set, a factor score or a factor classification. Conditions can be grouped together into sets, for example, a condition set can contain a condition for gender and for age. This entiy stores the link between a <a href=RecommendationAdmin.html>recommendation</a> and a <a href=ConditionData.html>condition</a> or <a href=ConditionSet.html>condition set</a>.



</p> 



<p><b>Example</b></p>


<p>

An <a href=OutcomePlan.html>outcome plan</a> is created for <a href=CaseParticipantRole.html>James Smith</a>, <a href=CaseParticipantRole.html>Linda Smith</a> and their child <a href=CaseParticipantRole.html>Robert</a> to identify and address their issues. James Smith is classified as having a Need in Substance Abuse. Adolescent Substance Abuse Treatment and Adult Inpatient Substance Abuse Treatment have been configured as recommendations for clients classified as having a Need in Substance Abuse. A condition has been associated with Adolescent Substance Abuse Treatment such that it is only recommended if the client is between the ages of 16 and 18. A condition set has been associated with Adult Inpatient Substance Abuse Treatment such that it is only recommended to male clients over the age of 18. Based on this condition, Adult Inpatient Substance Abuse Treatment is recommended for James as he is over the age of 18 and is a male. This entity stores the link between the configured recommendations of Adult Inpatient Substance Abuse Treatment, Adolescent Substance Abuse Treatment and the <a href=ConditionSet.html>condition set</a>.

<p><b>Example</b></p>
A case worker creates a Back to Work service plan for participant Linda Smith as she has recently become unemployed. A Gain Sustainable Employment goal is selected for this service plan. Linda requires assistance with a job search, therefore a Find a Job sub-goal is added to the service plan. 

The Full-time Job Search plan item is added to the service plan to achieve the service plan sub-goal. 

The plan item is submitted for approval. On approval by a supervisor, a task is created and allocated to the owner of the planned item to assist Linda Smith with her job search.

<P>The records on this table may also stipulate that task allocation is blocked for a specified <a href=Users.html>User</a> on the system.</P> 

<P>For task redirection, the redirect from user specifies the name of the user that the tasks will be redirected from while the redirect to user specifies the name of the user that the tasks will be redirected to. A start and end date time is specified to each task redirection record during which the tasks will be redirected. This also means that task redirections can be set up only for future dates.</P>

<P>For task allocation blocking, the redirect from user specifies the name of the user that the allocation of tasks will be blocked for. In this instance, a start and end date time is specified to each task allocation blocking record during which no tasks will be allocated to that <a href=Users.html>User</a>.</P>

<p><b>Example</b></p>
<P>The following is an example of task redirection.</P>

<P>A <a href=Users.html>User</a> John Walsh has put in a request for annual leave for a specified week. His supervisor <a href=Users.html>User</a> Ronan Rooney then sets up a task redirection record for this specified period.</P>

<P>The start date time for the task redirection period is the first day of <a href=Users.html>User</a> John Walsh's specified week of annual leave. The end date and time is the last day of the specified week of annual leave.</P>

<P>The supervisor also specifies that the <a href=Task.html>Task</a> that were to be assigned to <a href=Users.html>User</a> John Walsh will be assigned to <a href=Users.html>User</a> Peter Johnson during this week.</P>

<P>During the period of time specified by the task redirection record, the Workflow Engine will assign any <a href=Task.html>Task</a> that were to be assigned to <a href=Users.html>User</a> John Walsh to <a href=Users.html>User</a> Peter Johnson.</P>

<p><b>Example</b></p>
<P>The following is an example of task allocation blocking.</P>

<P>A <a href=Users.html>User</a> Peter Prior has been on sick leave for a week. His supervisor <a href=Users.html>User</a> Ronan Rooney realizes that there are now too many tasks assigned to Peter and sets up a task allocation blocking period to allow Peter to catch up with his workload.</P>

<P>The start date time for the task allocation blocking period is the current date and time. Ronan Rooney specifies that it should take Peter four days to catch up with his workload and so specifies the end date and time for the allocation blocking period to be four days from the current date and time.</P>

<P>During the period of time specified by the task allocation blocking record, the task allocation assignment algorithm will not allocate any tasks to Peter Prior. Once the end date and time of the task allocation blocking period expires, tasks will be allocated to <a href=Users.html>User</a> Peter Prior as normal.</P>

:</b>
<i>Describes a mapping used to transform from Evidence XML to an XML format that can be used to populate a datastore or a mapping from datastore back to Evidence XML.
</i>

<p>This entity is central to the functioning of the DataHub. A Transform stores a mapping in XSLT. There are two types of mappings,

            mappings for reads and mappings for updates, the type of mapping is identified by the type field. Mappings for reads transform data from Evidence Entities to data store XML.

            Mappings for updates take a Difference Command and turn it back into a set of requests to change or update Evidence Entities.

            A Difference Command is built by comparing &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; snapshots of a datastore. The before

            snapshot represents the state of a datastore before an IEG script has been run. The after snapshot represents the state of

            the datastore after a client has executed an IEG script. The Difference Command captures what actions they performed in that

            script in terms of the changes made to the data store.</p>

<br/>

<p>The logicalName and type fields taken together for Transform must be unique. The logical name is identified with a particular Data Hub Context.

          This Data Hub Context collect together a set of entities that share the same Data Hub Context name: A Transform, <a href=FilterEvidenceLink.html>Filter Evidence Link</a>, 

          a <a href=ViewProcessor.html>View Processor</a> and <a href=UpdateProcessor.html>Update Processor</a>.</p>

<p><b>Example</b></p>
<p>The &quot;Having a Baby&quot; Life Event is linked to the Data Hub Context called HavingABaby. This Life Event allows a client to log in and

            report that they or someone in their family is going to have a baby. The Life Event is linked to the Data Hub Context &quot;HavingABaby&quot;.

            When the Life Event is launched it is pre-populated with information about the family that has been read from Cúram Evidence.

            This information is read from the Evidence Tables and then the logical name &quot;HavingABaby&quot; is used to retrieve a Transform to convert

            This evidence into a Data Store. This pre-populated datastore is used for the IEG Script. The Citizen answers all the questions in the IEG

            Script and submits it. The Life Event engine calculates what has changed in the datastore and submits this to the data hub with the

            context &quot;HavingABaby&quot;. The Data Hub queries for a Transform update script with the logical name of &quot;HavingABaby&quot;.

            This Transform is then used to convert the differences into a set of updates to Evidence.

:</b>
<i>Specifies the percentage range for a visit compliance level.
</i>


<p>

Visit compliance measures whether or not a visitor was compliant with his or her expectations with regards to the frequency of visits with the visited client in question. 

Visit compliance is calculated based on certain criteria including the visit duration, the contact method and whether the visit was scheduled, rescheduled or unscheduled. The compliancy calculation produces a compliance percentage value by comparing the compliant visits to the number of planned visit in for a particular review period. The compliance level is determined by comparing the calculated compliance percentage against min and max compliance ranges defined. 

</p>

<p><b>Example</b></p>

Daniel Smith is an 18 month child who has been placed in a foster care home as it was deemed by the child welfare agency that he was not safe staying at home with his mother, Julie Smith. <br/>

The child welfare caseworker dealing with Daniel creates an outcome plan for the family. The caseworker creates a visitation plan for Daniel and Julie to maintain relationships. The visitation plan outlines that Julie must make two face-to-face visits per month.  Julie completes her scheduled visits with Daniel in accordance with the visitation plan. The caseworker decides to perform a 6 month review, and as part of the review, the caseworker evaluates the visits between Julie and Daniel.

</i>


<p>

Visits can be reviewed as part of an outcome plan review to allow a user to evaluate the effectiveness and appropriateness of visits (or interactions) between the client visited and the visitor for whom a visitation has been scheduled during the outcome plan review period. The system presents the user with details of the client visited and visitor and the relevant log records that fall within the review period along with the calculated compliance. Visit compliance is calculated based on certain criteria including the visit duration, the contact method and whether the visit was scheduled, rescheduled or unscheduled. The actual compliant visits are then compared to the planned visits for the review period to determine the compliance value for the visits. The caseworker reviews the visits and compliance and enters an evaluation.

<p>

Visitation plans specify the planned interactions that occur between the one or more client(s) and one or more visitors. Visitation plans, which can be court ordered, or mutually agreed upon by the agency and the family, typically specify when, how and where a visitation occurs as well as the frequency and the duration of the planned interactions. When creating a visitation plan, the caseworker must identify the participants involved. A client can have multiple visitation plans active at any time.

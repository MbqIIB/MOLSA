      HTML Help a popular format and the files produced by DocMaker are
      compatible with many third-party help authoring systems from Microsoft,
      Macromedia and others. However, integration with such third-party
      systems is not the primary purpose of DocMaker; DocMaker provides
      everything required to create and deploy a fully-functional online help
      system without the need for any other tools.</p><p>DocMaker not only generates the HTML Help files, it also includes
      two systems that can be used to access that help content: a Java Help
      Applet that displays the table of contents and search controls for the
      help content in the browser and allows applications to invoke the online
      help in a context-sensitive manner; and a Help Server, a server-side
      implementation providing the same functionality as the applet but that
      is deployed and executed in a J2EE web container. The applet has the
      advantage that it can be executed without a web container or web
      server&mdash;for example, from a CD-ROM&mdash;but, while it is
      accessible and meets modern accessibility guidelines, it does not meet
      the older W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 1.0 that do
      not permit applets. The applet also requires that JavaScript is enabled
      for context-sensitive access to the help system. The Help Server
      requires a J2EE web container, but does not require an applet or
      JavaScript to support context-sensitive access to the help system or for
      any of its basic functionality. It is meets the WCAG 1.0 guidelines for
      accessibility. However, for improved usability, JavaScript should be
      enabled, as it is required to support the collapsing and expanding of
      the entries in the table of contents and for the synchronization of the
      table of contents to the current help content page. The Help Applet can
      be deployed along with the Help Server and both can be used
      simultaneously if desired, though a C&uacute;ram application can only be
      configured to launch context-sensitive help using one or the
      other.</p><p>For the most part, there is little that you have to do to generate
      online HTML Help other than to execute DocMaker's
      <tt class="option">generate-help</tt> target. However, to support
      context-sensitivity and accessibility, some extra information is
      required in the DocBook XML content.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="section_titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="DMN125E3"></a>Accessibility</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>The online help for C&uacute;ram applications is required to be
      accessible by disabled users. There are a number of extra requirements
      that your DocBook XML content must meet to ensure the online help will
      be accessible:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Each table must have a summary describing its contents. See
          <a href="DMN111E0.html#DMN1136D" title="Accessibility">the section, <i>Accessibility</i></a> for more
          details.</p></li><li><p>Each image must have an alternative text representation and a
          longer description describing its contents. See <a href="DMN10F46.html#DMN1109D" title="Accessibility">the section, <i>Accessibility</i></a> for
          more details.</p></li></ul></div><p>When you run DocMaker's <tt class="option">check</tt> target, and the
      <tt class="sgmltag-attribute">role</tt> attribute of your
      <tt class="sgmltag-element">book</tt> element is set to <tt class="sgmltag-attvalue">user</tt>, the accessibility of your content will
      be checked automatically. Once you meet these requirements, DocMaker
      will generate help content that is accessible.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="section_titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="DMN12612"></a>Organization of HTML Output Files</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>Unlike the PDF output where a single PDF file is created, the HTML
      Help output is comprised of a large number of HTML files, Java archive
      (JAR) files and image files. All of these are created and located
      automatically, so there is no need for any manual intervention. However,
      it is important to be able to identify the main files and to understand
      how they are organized so that you can deploy your HTML Help content
      successfully.</p><p>The files are created below the <tt class="filename">help</tt> folder
      within the DocMaker output folder (usually called
      <tt class="filename">doc</tt>). Within the <tt class="filename">help</tt> folder,
      there will be one folder for each book generated. The
      <tt class="filename">help</tt> folder itself will contain the
      <i class="firstterm">top-level</i> help system that can be used to present
      all of the books in the set. The top-level help system is configured to
      run both the Help Applet and the Help Server. Each book folder also
      contains the necessary files to distribute help using the Help Applet
      only; the Help Server is not configured at this level. To make the Help
      Server easier to deploy, a single <i class="firstterm">help.war</i>
      archive file is located in the help folder and it contains a
      fully-configured J2EE application that can be deployed to a web
      container. This WAR file also contains the Help Applet, so, on deploying
      the help application, both the Help Server and the Help Applet can be
      served simultaneously. The WAR file contains all of the files in the
      help folder and sub folders, so, even if it is not to be deployed to a
      web container, it can be used to distribute the help system. Its
      contents could, for example, be extracted to a CD-ROM used to distribute
      applet-based help.</p><p>There are five main types of files created in the
      <tt class="filename">help</tt> folder and in the book sub-folders:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">HTML Content Files</span></dt><dd><p>These are created in the book folders only, not at the top
            level. For each chapter and top-level section in your DocBook
            source content, a separate HTML file is created. These names of
            these files are generated automatically; they usually begin with
            the letters &ldquo;<span class="quote">DM</span>&rdquo; followed by a unique node number.
            Each file represents a single page of your HTML Help
            content.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">HTML Frameset Files</span></dt><dd><p>To organize all the HTML content files, a HTML
            <span class="emphasis"><em>frameset</em></span> is used. A frameset is a HTML file
            that defines how the display area of a web browser should be
            sub-divided into separate areas, each of which will display the
            contents of a separate HTML file. These areas are called
            <span class="emphasis"><em>frames</em></span>. There are two frameset files, one for
            applet-based help and one for server-based help. The framesets are
            defined in the <tt class="filename">index.html</tt> and
            <tt class="filename">index.jsp</tt> files respectively. This
            <tt class="filename">index.html</tt> file defines two frames: on the
            left, a frame for the Help Applet configured in the
            <tt class="filename">applet.html</tt> file; and on the right, a frame
            for the help content that defaults to displaying the
            <tt class="filename">book-index.html</tt> file that contains the book
            title and legal notice. The <tt class="filename">index.jsp</tt> file
            contains four frames: on the left are three frames, one for the
            logo, one for the table of contents and one for the search
            results; the frame on the right is the same as that used for
            applet-based help. Both the top-level <tt class="filename">help</tt>
            folder and the book folders will contain an
            <tt class="filename">index.html</tt> file that can be used to start
            applet-based help. The <tt class="filename">index.jsp</tt> file appears
            only in the top-level <tt class="filename">help</tt> folder.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Image Files</span></dt><dd><p>Image files include both the images you have referenced from
            your DocBook content files and other images that are included
            automatically during rendering, such as the C&uacute;ram logo, the icons
            for tips and warnings, and navigation buttons. These latter images
            are shared by all of the generated books and are placed in a
            separate folder from the images explicitly referenced from your
            content.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">HTML Help Meta-data Files</span></dt><dd><p>DocMaker generates a number of files that contain meta-data
            relevant to the development of a HTML Help system. These files use
            standard names are in standard formats that can be interpreted by
            any help development tools that support the HTML Help format.
            DocMaker only requires two of these meta-data files: the
            <tt class="filename">toc.hhc</tt> file containing the table of contents
            information that associates chapter and section titles with HTML
            content files; and the <tt class="filename">alias.h</tt> file that
            associates topic names with HTML content files. The other
            meta-data files are deleted automatically, but they can be made
            available if required.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Java Archive (JAR) Files</span></dt><dd><p>The Help Applet used to present the table of contents and
            support context-sensitivity is stored in a JAR file included in
            the DocMaker installation. This JAR file is copied into the HTML
            Help output folder for each book and the meta-data files are moved
            inside the archive. When a user opens the frameset containing the
            applet frame and the content frame, the JAR file is downloaded and
            the applet is executed. The applet then loads the table of
            contents and the topic names from these meta-data files and begins
            operating. The help server uses many of the same facilities as the
            help applet, but the servlet classes are packaged in an additional
            JAR file.</p></dd></dl></div><p>If you want to deploy your HTML Help content, you must preserve
      the way the files are organized when they are created by DocMaker. All
      of the files are created below the <tt class="filename">help</tt> folder of
      your output folder (the output folder is called
      <tt class="filename">doc</tt>, unless your build system has overridden the
      name). Within the help folder, you will see an
      <tt class="filename">images</tt> folder and one folder for each book, just as
      you would see them in your documentation root folder. The
      <tt class="filename">images</tt> folder contains the common icons supplied by
      DocMaker, and within each book folder, you will find the HTML content
      files, frameset files and the JAR file for the book; the image files
      referenced by a book are organized within the folder exactly as they
      were in the original DocBook book folder.</p><p>When deploying your help content, you must copy the relevant book
      folders to the required location and you must copy the
      <tt class="filename">images</tt> folder and place it in the same location
      relative to your book folders, i.e., the <tt class="filename">images</tt>
      folder must be copied to the same location as the book folders. If you
      do not preserve this relative location, the image references in the HTML
      content files will be invalid.</p><p>The HTML Help content can be deployed to a web server, or to a
      local filesystem (including a CD-ROM). The applet-based help system
      contains no dynamic content and does not require the execution of any
      scripts on a web server. The system is managed entirely by the Help
      Applet that is downloaded via the frameset. To access the content for a
      book, only the <tt class="filename">index.html</tt> frameset file needs to be
      opened. A link to this file can contain a topic name parameter, as
      described in <a href="DMN12127.html#DMN121FF" title="Context-Sensitivity">the section, <i>Context-Sensitivity</i></a>, but this
      parameter is interpreted by the applet, so, again, no web server is
      required. The Help Server does require a web container to operate, but
      is otherwise similar to the Help Applet; the
      <tt class="filename">index.jsp</tt> frameset file can be passed the same
      topic name parameter as would be passed to the Help Applet (see
      below).</p><p>If you have several books containing HTML Help content, you can
      access them individually, as above, or as a single set of books. In the
      output <tt class="filename">help</tt> folder, along with the
      <tt class="filename">images</tt> folder and the output book folders, you will
      find another copy of the applet JAR file and some frameset files. The
      <tt class="filename">index.html</tt> file located here will access the help
      content using an applet that contains copies of the meta-data files for
      <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> of the books and thus displays a table of
      contents that shows each book at the root level and allows the user to
      navigate to any page in any book. Context-sensitive invocations also
      work as before. When deploying this Help Applet, it must be located in
      the same position relative to the book folders, as it only links to the
      HTML content files in those folders and the relative links must be
      preserved. The Help Server does not support help for a single book in a
      set of books, only top-level help for the entire set (though a set can
      contain only one book).</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="section_titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="DMN126F1"></a>Invoking Context-Sensitive Help</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>Context-sensitivity and the use of page IDs as topic names was
      covered in <a href="DMN12127.html#DMN121FF" title="Context-Sensitivity">the section, <i>Context-Sensitivity</i></a>. The details
      here describe how you can integrate context-sensitive help into an
      application.</p><p>When an application launches the context sensitive help, it must
      supply the topic name to the Help Applet or Help Server. This is
      accomplished by simply linking to one of two files,
      <tt class="filename">index.html</tt> or <tt class="filename">index.jsp</tt>
      respectively, and adding a topic name parameter to the URI for that
      link. The choice of Help Server or Help Applet and the generation of
      these links is handled automatically within a C&uacute;ram client application.
      For example, to request the online help (using the Help Applet) for the
      &ldquo;<span class="quote">Application_home</span>&rdquo; page, the URI would be <tt class="systemitem">index.html?topicname=Application_home</tt>, as
      long as the online help contains some content is marked with that page
      ID as the topic name. Depending on how the online HTML Help has been
      deployed, the full URL may include the name of the HTTP server and the
      path to the <tt class="filename">index.html</tt> file. For the URL to be
      valid, the topic name must be encoded using the method specified in
      <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt" target="_top">RFC 1738</a>;
      however, most topic names will be unchanged, as the encoding is only
      necessary for certain reserved characters. Parameters are passed to the
      <tt class="filename">index.jsp</tt> file in the same manner.</p><div class="note"><table border="0" summary="Note: Backward Compatibility"><tr><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="2" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="../images/note.gif"></td><th align="left"><a name="DMN1271B"></a>Backward Compatibility</th></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" colspan="2"><p>Older C&uacute;ram client applications used online help generated by

        first parameter name as the name of the topic, but only when no other

          failing of either system, but is simply the result of having two
          different user interfaces that each have different default keyboard
          shortcuts. The Help Applet uses a Java Swing graphical user
          interface and the keyboard shortcuts are the default ones that users
          will expect when using such an interface. Similarly, the Help Server
          delivers content in HTML format to the browser and the keyboard
          shortcuts are simply the standard shortcuts implemented by the
          browser to navigate through HTML content. No attempt has been made

        of contents for one or more books and provide a means to search the
        content. It appears on the left of the browser window in its own
        frame. The table of contents is displayed as a tree of book, chapter,
        and section titles mirroring the hierarchical structure of the book.
        The results of a search are displayed in a list in order of relevance;
        each entry is the title of a section that matches the search terms and
        a tool-tip provides more information about the book and chapter in
        which that section was found.</p><p>Within the Help Applet, the mouse or the <span class="keycap">Tab</span>
        key can be used to move the focus between the controls. To change
        between the Contents and the Search tabs using the keyboard, set the
        focus to the label of the active tab and use the <span class="keycap">Left</span>
        or <span class="keycap">Right</span> arrow key to switch to the other tab. The
        size of the font used in the Help Applet can be changed within certain
        limits: use <span class="keycap">Ctrl</span>-<span class="keycap">-</span> to decrease the font size and <span class="keycap">Ctrl</span>-<span class="keycap">=</span> to increase it.</p><p>The <span class="guilabel">Contents</span> tab presents a tree control
        with a hierarchical view of the contents of the online help
        documentation. The use of the table of contents tree is very
        straightforward: double-clicking on a title, or clicking a
        &ldquo;<span class="quote">+</span>&rdquo; icon beside a title, will expand that title to
        display the titles of the contained elements; single-clicking on a
        title will open the corresponding help page. If using the keyboard,
        the arrow keys can be used to navigate the tree: the
        <span class="keycap">Up</span> and <span class="keycap">Down</span> arrow keys move through
        the visible tree entries and the <span class="keycap">Right</span> and
        <span class="keycap">Left</span> arrow keys expand and collapse the tree nodes
        respectively. If only one book is being managed by the Help Applet,
        then the book title in the table of contents will be expanded
        automatically to display the chapter titles when the applet first
        loads; otherwise, two or more unexpanded book titles will be
        displayed.</p><p>Searching is performed on the <span class="guilabel">Search</span> tab by
        entering some search terms in the <span class="guilabel">Search</span> text
        field and then pressing the <span class="keycap">Enter</span> key or clicking the
        <span class="guibutton">Search</span> button. The results, if any, are then
        displayed in the list and the number of results is shown in the

        <span class="keycap">Up</span> and <span class="keycap">Down</span> arrow keys can be used
        to select entries in the list. Selecting an entry in the results list
        will open the corresponding help page.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="section_titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="DMN127BC"></a>Help Server</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>The Help Server, the alternative to the Help Applet, displays
        the table of contents and the search controls in separate frames to
        the left of the help content. The browser's keyboard shortcuts are
        used to navigate through the content in these frames. As these
        shortcuts are browser-dependent, the user should be directed to their
        browser's help information for details on their use. However, in most
        browsers, the <span class="keycap">Tab</span> key is used to move from
        link-to-link within the frames and the <span class="keycap">Enter</span> key is
        used to activate the selected link.</p><p>The Contents frame and the Search frame both display a heading
        at the top of the frame to indicate their purpose. When JavaScript is
        enabled, a button showing up and down arrows appears to the left of
        these headings and can be used to automatically resize the frames.
        Pressing the button in either frame will resize the frames so that the
        height of the larger of the two frames is decreased to the height of
        its heading; the height of the other frame will be increased to use
        all of the remaining space. This makes it easy to resize the frames so
        that the maximum amount of space is used to display the table of
        contents or the search results, as the user prefers. The contents of
        the frames will not be scrolled by this operation, so when a frame is
        enlarged again, the content will be in the same position as it was
        when the frame was contracted. With or without JavaScript, the frames
        can be resized manually to any size by dragging the frame borders with
        the mouse. By default, when the help system is first started, the
        frames will be of equal size.</p><p>The appearance of the table of contents differs depending on the
        availability of JavaScript. Without JavaScript, the table of contents
        appears as a hierarchy of entries with chapters indented below books
        and sections indented below chapters. Where an entry has some related
        content at a lower level (for example, a section containing
        sub-sections) it appears with a plain bullet icon to the left.</p><p>When JavaScript is enabled, the table of contents tree is
        modified automatically when the page is loaded. The tree is
        &ldquo;<span class="quote">collapsed</span>&rdquo; to show only the book titles and the plain
        bullet icons are replaced with &ldquo;<span class="quote">plus</span>&rdquo; icons to indicate
        that the nodes can be expanded if the icon is clicked. When expanded,
        the icon changes to a &ldquo;<span class="quote">minus</span>&rdquo; icon and the lower-level
        entries are displayed. Clicking the icon will now collapse the entry,
        hiding the lower-level entries and changing the icon back to a
        &ldquo;<span class="quote">plus</span>&rdquo; icon. This behavior is the same as the behavior of
        the table of contents tree in the Help Applet. For keyboard users, an
        entry can be expanded or collapsed using the <span class="keycap">+</span> and
        <span class="keycap">-</span> keys when the link for the entry has the input
        focus. In most browsers, the <span class="keycap">Up</span> and
        <span class="keycap">Down</span> arrow keys can be used to scroll the contents of
        the frame.</p><p>Searching the content is similar to searching using the Help
        Applet: search terms are entered in the search text field and the
        search button is activated. Search results are displayed below the
        search text field. Each result displays a link to the matching section
        and the name of the book and chapter containing that section. The
        score displayed indicates the relevance of the result and the results
        are sorted with highest scores first. This is the same order as that
        used by the Help Applet, though the applet does not display the score
        values.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="section_titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="DMN127F5"></a>Help Content Pages</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>One help page is generated for each top-level section in a book.
        The first section in each chapter appears on the same page as the
        title for that chapter. A single page is also generated containing the
        title of the book, the abstract of the book (if present), and the
        legal notice.</p><p>On each help page, a navigation tool-bar is displayed above and
        below the content of the page. The tool-bar at the bottom is always
        located so that it cannot be seen without first scrolling down. This
        avoids cluttering the presentation with two tool-bars when the content
        is short. The tool-bar is shown below. Not all of the tool-bar buttons
        are always visible; their presence depends on the location of the
        current page within the book or the availability of JavaScript. The
        buttons on the tool-bar are hyperlinked images that link to other
        pages or execute scripts. For accessibility, each button has an
        associated <i class="firstterm">access key</i> that can be used to
        change the input focus to that button without using the mouse. To
        activate a button using an access key, press the <span class="keycap">Alt</span>
        key and the access key together to change the focus to the button and
        then press the <span class="keycap">Enter</span> key. In some browsers, pressing
        the access key will immediately activate the link and you do not have
        to press <span class="keycap">Enter</span>.</p><div class="figure"><a name="DMN1280F"></a><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/help-tool-bar.gif" alt="The Online HTML Help Tool-bar"></div><p class="title"><b>Figure:&nbsp;The Online HTML Help Tool-bar</b></p></div><p>From left-to-right, the buttons are as follows:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Home</span></dt><dd><p>Opens the home page for the current book containing the

              relevant chapter page (containing the chapter title and the
              first section) is opened; when viewing a chapter page, the book

              This is useful when a hyperlinked cross-reference or a search
              result jumps to another page and the user wants to determine the
              context for that page or read related pages. This button is only
              displayed when JavaScript is available, as synchronization
              requires JavaScript to perform the operation. The access key for

              both the Help Applet and the Help Server. When synchronizing the

              entry in the table of contents is highlighted with a yellow
              background that quickly fades back to the normal background
              color. This helps to draw the user's attention to the entry, as
              the sudden jump in the table of contents can otherwise be

        tool-bar buttons or hyperlinked internal cross-references, the table
        of contents is not automatically synchronized with the page content; a
        user can use the tool-bar button to do this manually at any time.
        However, when starting the online help using a topic name for
        context-sensitivity, or when activating a hyperlinked external
        cross-reference to a different book within a set of books displayed by
        the Help Applet, the table of contents is synchronized automatically
        to the target page. This synchronization is not automatic when using
        the Help Server.</p><p>Your browser will determine which keys you need to use to change
        the input focus between the control frames on the left and the help

        input focus to an applet or out of an applet. To assist you, a button
        is provided at the top of the applet frame that, when activated, will
        cause the input focus to change to the Help Applet. The access key for

      chapters, appendices, and sections. However, for some types of online
      help, it may be desirable to suppress the entries for some of the
      content. For example, you may not want to display entries for an
      appendix that contains hundreds of sections, one for each possible error
      message that the system can report. To suppress the inclusion of these
      entries, the <tt class="sgmltag-attribute">role</tt> attribute of any
      <tt class="sgmltag-element">chapter</tt>, <tt class="sgmltag-element">appendix</tt> or
      <tt class="sgmltag-element">section</tt> element can be set to <tt class="sgmltag-attvalue">no-toc</tt>. This will suppress the entry in the
      table of contents for the element and all of its descendant elements.
      When used on <tt class="sgmltag-element">section</tt> elements, it is possible to
      suppress only some <tt class="sgmltag-element">section</tt> elements within a
      <tt class="sgmltag-element">chapter</tt> or <tt class="sgmltag-element">appendix</tt>, and not
      all.</p><p>Setting the <tt class="sgmltag-attribute">role</tt> attribute to
      <tt class="sgmltag-attvalue">no-toc</tt> on any other type of element
      will have no effect; you cannot apply this to a <tt class="sgmltag-element">book</tt>
      element, for example. It will also have no effect on the table of
      contents displayed for output formats other than HTML Help.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="section_titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="DMN128B6"></a>Localizing Online Help</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>The Help Applet, Help Server and the boilerplate text in the help
      content can be localized to match the language used in the content. The
      localization of the Help Applet is achieved by adding a Java-style
      properties file to the applet's JAR file using Java's standard
      locale-specific naming convention. The boilerplate text in the help
      content is localized by adding entries to an XML properties file used by
      the XSLT stylesheets that generate the HTML.</p><p>To localize the Help Applet, you need to add an appropriate
      properties file to the Help Applet JAR file
      <tt class="filename">lib\help-applet.jar</tt> in your DocMaker installation.
      The English language properties file is already present, so follow these
      steps to add your localized text:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Expand the <tt class="filename">lib\help-applet.jar</tt> file in a
          temporary location and locate the contained
          <tt class="filename">HelpUI.properties</tt> file in the extracted
          <tt class="filename">curam\docmaker\tools\help</tt> folder.</p></li><li><p>Make a copy of the <tt class="filename">HelpUI.properties</tt>
          file in the same folder and append the locale name to the end of the
          new file name, separating the locale from the existing name using an
          underscore character. For example, for the &ldquo;<span class="quote">fr_CA</span>&rdquo;
          locale, the file should be named
          <tt class="filename">HelpApplet_fr_CA.properties</tt>.</p></li><li><p>Edit this new file and localize the text for each
          property.</p></li><li><p>Create a new JAR file from the entire folder structure
          extracted from the original JAR file, a folder structure that now
          includes the new properties file, and replace the existing
          <tt class="filename">lib\help-applet.jar</tt> file with this new JAR
          file.</p></li></ol></div><p>To generate content with the correctly localized boilerplate text,
      the localized text needs to be added to the file
      <tt class="filename">lib\xsl-custom\common\l10n.xml</tt> in your DocMaker
      installation. This file already contains the basic English language
      text, so perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Locate the <tt class="sgmltag-element">l:l10n</tt> element and duplicate the
          element and all of its contents creating a second element alongside
          the first.</p></li><li><p>In the copy of the <tt class="sgmltag-element">l:l10n</tt> element, change
          the <tt class="sgmltag-element">language</tt> attribute to the name of your locale
          (just the language code can be used if the country code is not
          significant).</p></li><li><p>Within the <tt class="sgmltag-element">l:l10n</tt> element, locate each
          <tt class="sgmltag-element">l:gentext</tt> or <tt class="sgmltag-element">l:template</tt>
          element (the latter are nested within <tt class="sgmltag-element">l:context</tt>
          elements) and change the value of the <tt class="sgmltag-attribute">text</tt> attribute of each to the text
          appropriate for the language being used.</p></li></ol></div><p>There are only a limited number of elements that need to be
      localized in the <tt class="filename">lib\xsl-custom\common\l10n.xml</tt>
      file. Most of the localization for many common languages is already
      done. However, if there is no file in the
      <tt class="filename">lib\docbook-xsl\common</tt> folder for your required
      language (the files are named using the locale name and the
      <tt class="filename">.xml</tt> extension), you will have to create a file
      there by copying an existing file and making the appropriate changes to
      the <tt class="sgmltag-attribute">text</tt> attributes. If this is
      required, you should also add an entry to the
      <tt class="filename">lib\docbook-xsl\common\l10n.xml</tt> file for your new
      locale following the format of the other entries.</p><p>By default DocMaker will generate content using the
      &ldquo;<span class="quote">en</span>&rdquo; locale (though &ldquo;<span class="quote">en_US</span>&rdquo; is used for
      spell-checking), but this can be overridden by setting the
      <tt class="property">docmaker.help.locale</tt> property on the command line.
      For example, to set the locale to Spanish, the following command is
      used:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
          <b class="userinput"><tt>
            <span><b class="command">docmaker</b></span>

            <tt class="option">generate-help</tt>

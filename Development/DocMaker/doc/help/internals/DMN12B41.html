      use when editing DocBook XML files. However, there are a number of
      issues that arise in their daily use that must be understood. Unless you
      are careful, you can make life considerably harder for yourself and
      other authors. Most of the issues relate to document encoding and
      formatting and how these affect the interactions with the source code
      management (<span class="acronym">SCM</span>) system.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="section_titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="DMN12B52"></a>Encoding</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>The encoding of a document is critically important. The encoding
      defines the character set that the document uses; knowledge of the
      encoding allows other systems to correctly interpret the character data
      that makes up a DocBook XML file. As the file is in XML, the standard
      XML processing instruction at the top of the file can be used to declare
      the encoding used by the file. If you use an XML editor, it will
      recognize this encoding declaration and interpret the file in that
      manner. Similarly, XML editors can either save the data in the declared
      encoding, or can be configured to save all files using a specific
      encoding, changing the encoding declaration in the file to the
      appropriate value in the process. However, few text editors recognize
      the declared encoding of an XML file and will not necessarily respect
      that encoding when saving a file. It possible for an author to use a
      text editor to open a file that uses one encoding and then save it using
      an encoding different to the one declared in the file. The data in the
      file is now corrupt, though the degree of corruption may vary depending
      on the characters used. It is important, therefore, that the author is
      aware of the encoding that should be used at all times.</p><p>If document files use many different encodings and text editors
      make managing the encoding a bit hit-and-miss (or tedious, at best), it
      makes sense to simplify the process. By using a single encoding for all
      files, the process becomes less error-prone. As all C&uacute;ram documents are
      written in English (US or GB variants), the Western European language
      encoding defined in the ISO-8859-1 (&ldquo;<span class="quote">ISO Latin 1</span>&rdquo;) standard
      is a good compromise. This character set defines the encoding of nearly
      all of the characters (including the commonly used &ldquo;<span class="quote">&uacute;</span>&rdquo;)
      that you will need for C&uacute;ram documents. It is also one of the most
      widely used encodings and almost every text editor that can handle
      multiple encodings can handle this character set.</p><p>You might wonder why the equally well supported and more versatile
      UTF-8 encoding is not a better solution. The answer is simple: try
      typing an em-dash, right or left double-quotes, or any Chinese
      characters using your keyboard. Unless you have a non-English keyboard
      setup, or know the codes for these characters, you will not be able to
      do it. While the Chinese characters might not be very relevant to you,
      the other punctuation characters may be. Microsoft though them important
      enough that it embraced the ISO Latin 1 character set and extended it to
      include the left and right variants of the single and double quotation
      marks, the em-dash, the en-dash, the Euro symbol, the trademark symbol,
      the bullet mark, and several others. This character encoding is dubbed
      &ldquo;<span class="quote">Windows Latin 1</span>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<span class="quote">Windows ANSI</span>&rdquo;,
      &ldquo;<span class="quote">windows-1252</span>&rdquo;, or &ldquo;<span class="quote">CP1252</span>&rdquo;, though that list
      of names is not exhaustive. The problem is that this encoding does not
      have the same level of cross-platform support as ISO Latin 1. As it is
      difficult to type most of the extended characters on the keyboard, it is
      of little extra benefit in any event.</p><p>ISO Latin 1 is a subset of Windows Latin 1, so it is safe to allow
      it to be interpreted as Windows Latin 1, though care must be taken not
      to enter any of the extended characters when editing. DocBook XML
      documents should use the <tt class="sgmltag-element">quote</tt> element instead of
      quotation marks, use the itemizedlist where bullet marks are needed, and
      use the product element when a trademark symbol is required, this leaves
      only the fairly common em-dash and Euro symbol, and the less common
      en-dash to be handled. The Euro symbol is supported by ISO-8859-15
      (&ldquo;<span class="quote">ISO Latin 9</span>&rdquo;<sup>[<a href="#ftn.N1218C" name="N1218C">2</a>]</sup>, a small extension to ISO Latin 1), but that is not widely
      supported and it still does not provide the em-dash or en-dash
      characters.</p><p>The solution to all this lies in the fact that a program that
      manipulates the XML will interpret the character data using the declared
      encoding, but process it internally using a full Unicode encoding.
      Therefore, you can use XML &ldquo;<span class="quote">character entities</span>&rdquo; when
      entering characters that are not in the ISO Latin 1 character set. For
      example, the Unicode code for the em-dash is 8212, so, if you enter
      <tt class="sgmltag-genentity">&amp;#8212;</tt> in your document, it will be
      interpreted as an em-dash and, as all the characters in the character
      entity itself are in ISO Latin 1, it is safe to use this method. As life
      is too short to learn what code to use for what character, DocBook XML
      defines named entities for many commonly used characters. Instead of
      entering <tt class="sgmltag-genentity">&amp;#8212;</tt>, you can use
      <tt class="sgmltag-genentity">&amp;mdash;</tt> instead. Similarly, you can
      also use <tt class="sgmltag-genentity">&amp;ndash;</tt> and <tt class="sgmltag-genentity">&amp;euro;</tt> and many others. The codes used are not
      those defined by the Windows Latin 1 encoding, they are the Unicode
      (UTF-16) codes. You can even enter those Chinese characters in this
      manner. It is perfectly valid to write an XML document in Chinese that
      uses the ISO Latin 1 encoding as long as you use the character entities.
      The character data is all in the ISO Latin 1 encoding, but the
      information conveyed using that character set is actually in
      Chinese.</p><div class="tip"><table border="0" summary="Tip:

        the help it provides when entering characters that do not appear on
        your keyboard. It provides a list of Unicode characters and allows you
        to choose any and insert it into the document. If the character is
        defined in the ISO Latin 1 encoding, it will insert it literally. If
        the character is not defined by the encoding, it will insert a
        character entity instead. If the DocBook XML DTD defines a named
        character entity for that character code,
        <span class="application">XXE</span> will automatically insert the entity
        name instead of the code.</p><p>Unless you look at the actual XML file, you will be oblivious to
        all this; <span class="application">XXE</span> displays the actual character
        glyph on the screen and not the character entity, so you can forget
        about character sets and encodings and just keep writing.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>If ISO Latin 1 is accepted as the standard encoding for all
      documents, all the documents are in English, and few characters outside
      of this character set are required, the compromise is a good one: it is
      well supported, easy to enter at the keyboard, cross-platform, and is
      reasonably immune to mistakes that arise when it is confused with
      Windows Latin 1.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="section_titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="DMN12BC0"></a>Formatting</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>One of the benefits of using a plain text format like DocBook XML,
      rather than a proprietary binary format, is the easy of integration with
      <span class="acronym">SCM</span> systems. <span class="acronym">CVS</span> is used to manage
      C&uacute;ram documents and its facilities for automatic merging can be utilized
      for DocBook XML files. Unlike the former
      <span class="application">FrameMaker</span> documents, it is now possible to
      edit an single file from a book without locking all the other files and
      it is even practical for more than one person to edit the same file
      concurrently. The former is possible because there is no data about page
      numbers, paragraph numbering, cross-references, etc. in DocBook XML that
      causes dependencies between files in a book; all this information is
      calculated during rendering. The latter is now practical because
      <span class="acronym">CVS</span> can automatically merge the changes from two
      authors by comparing the content of the files. Using change histories,
      it is also possible to select two versions of a file and compare them
      using a suitable tool to identify the changes that were made between
      those versions.</p><p>Most of this newly enabled functionality depends on the way
      <span class="acronym">CVS</span> merges two versions of a file: it cannot merge
      two files if each contains changes made to the same lines of the
      original version (the &ldquo;<span class="quote">common ancestor</span>&rdquo;). Most of the time,
      these conflicts will be unavoidable and relatively easy to resolve.
      However, if an author's editor reformats the XML file (and most XML
      editors do this), it will likely change every line in the file and may
      cause a merge conflict if the file is also being edited by someone else,
      or, more likely, will render the change history unusable. The author may
      only have edited a single line, but by using an editor that reformatted
      the file, <span class="acronym">CVS</span> will consider every line
      changed.</p><p>Several ways to avoid this problem are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Use an editor that does not reformat the file (almost any text
          editor fits this bill, but few XML editors preserve the
          formatting).</p></li><li><p>Standardize on an XML editor that can be configured to format
          the file in the same manner for all authors (you can still use a
          text editor for changes).</p></li><li><p>Only support XML editors that can be configured to format
          files in an identical manner (no two editors allow such
          control).</p></li><li><p>Reformat all the files to a standard format before submission
          using a separate tool.</p></li></ul></div><p>For now, only the second option is supported. Bot text and XML
      editors are desirable, so any text editor can be used,
      <span class="application">XXE</span> is the recommended XML editor, and the
      commonly used <span class="application">Eclipse</span> XML editor can be used
      as it does not force you to reformat files. The last option is likely to
      be introduced at some point in the future and will include the added
      benefit that authors using text editors are not forced to deal with
      poorly formatted content created by other authors using text
      editors!</p></div></div></div><div class="footer"><p class="copyright">Licensed Materials - Property of IBM Corp, IBM Corporation and other(s) 1999,2012.

    stylesheets, and other third-party libraries that are combined to
    implement a tool that can convert DocBook XML content to PDF documents and
    online HTML Help content. DocMaker is supplied with most of the tools that
    it depends on, but there are some external dependencies.</p><p>A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.3 or later is required to
    run DocMaker. While Ant will report a warning if it cannot find a Java
    compiler when it is executed with a JRE instead of a Java Development Kit
    (JDK), this warning can be ignored. DocMaker does not require any of the
    extra features of a JDK, though a JDK can be used instead of a JRE if
    desired.</p><p>DocMaker's Ant scripts are compatible with Apache Ant 1.6.2.
    DocMaker includes this version of Ant and the DocMaker shell scripts use
    this installed version when invoking DocMaker. However, if the DocMaker
    Ant scripts are invoked directly from other Ant scripts or shell scripts,
    then the version of Ant used must be compatible with the version required
    by DocMaker.</p><p>Spelling checks are performed by invoking GNU Aspell from the Ant
    scripts. The scripts assume that <span><b class="command">aspell.exe</b></span> is on the
    system path and will fail if this is not the case. Most developer machines
    have Aspell installed and configured correctly as part of their ConMan
    installation. Custom deployments of DocMaker to other environments need to
    consider how Aspell should be installed for use with DocMaker. If spelling
    checks are not required, Aspell need not be installed. The spelling check
    operations cannot be executed on non-Windows platforms.</p><p>When generating PDF documents, DocMaker, through the Apache FOP
    library, requires font metric data for the fonts that it will use in the
    PDF. The metrics data for the &ldquo;<span class="quote">Trebuchet MS</span>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<span class="quote">Arial
    Narrow</span>&rdquo; fonts is supplied with DocMaker to complement the font
    metrics data supplied with FOP. However, these Microsoft fonts are not
    embedded in the PDF document, so the fonts cannot be displayed on machines
    that do not have these fonts installed (e.g., Unix machines). In these
    cases, the font metrics information will be used by <span class="productname">Adobe
    Acrobat Reader</span> (or other PDF viewer) to replace the
    preferred font with a suitable alternative font of exactly the same
    dimensions, so that formatting and layout are not affected.</p><p>The <tt class="option">help</tt> target used to launch DocMaker's own
    online HTML help content is not compatible with execution on non-Windows
    platforms. The is no such restriction on the generation of online HTML
    help content. All of the targets are described in <a href="DMN105BC.html" title="Using DocMaker"><i>Using DocMaker</i></a>.</p><p>DocMaker requires 512MB of heap space to support the rendering of
    large PDF documents (up to 1,000 pages). Extremely large or complex
    documents may require extra memory and smaller documents can be rendered
    with much less. By default, the DocMaker shell script set the maximum Java
    heap space to 512MB.</p></div></div><div class="footer"><p class="copyright">Licensed Materials - Property of IBM Corp, IBM Corporation and other(s) 1999,2012.

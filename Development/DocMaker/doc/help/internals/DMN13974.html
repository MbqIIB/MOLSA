      While <span class="application">FrameMaker</span> exports all the diagrams
      and images in your document to individual files, it does not embed
      adequate information in the <span class="acronym">XML</span> documents for
      DocMaker to create proper references to the graphic files. You will
      need to rename the graphic files and check the references to these
      files created by DocMaker. <span class="application">FrameMaker</span>
      was also instructed to output graphic files only in the
      <span class="acronym">GIF</span> (Graphics Interchange Format) and
      <span class="acronym">WMF</span> (Windows Mediafile)
      formats. The former is used for all images and the latter for diagrams
      drawn within <span class="application">FrameMaker</span>. The
      <span class="acronym">WMF</span> files must be converted to
      <span class="acronym">SVG</span> format to be compatible with DocMaker.

        do this type of conversion. Open the <span class="acronym">WMF</span> file,
        select the graphic, and then use the
        <span class="guimenu">File</span>&rarr;<span class="guimenuitem">Export...</span> menu option to export the file to
        <span class="acronym">SVG</span> format.

        SVG Containing Bitmaps</th></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" colspan="2"><p>
        If a <span class="acronym">WMF</span> format image file contains both a
        bitmap (e.g., a screen-shot) and drawing elements (e.g., arrows and
        text), then DocMaker may not be able to process the
        <span class="acronym">SVG</span> file created during conversion. It is best
        to convert these files to <span class="acronym">GIF</span> image files.
      </p></td></tr></table></div><p>
      The names of the image files match those of the original
      <span class="application">FrameMaker</span> file in which they appeared,
      though with the addition of a &ldquo;<span class="quote">sequence number</span>&rdquo; and
      a different extension. For example, the fifth image that was in
      the file <tt class="filename">UserGuide.fm</tt> would be output to a file
      named <tt class="filename">UserGuide-5.gif</tt>. The sequence numbers begin
      anew with each file in the book; books that contained only one main
      content file will result in image files with unique sequence numbers;
      books that contained many files will result in image files with
      sequence numbers that repeat as each file is processed. DocMaker can
      preserve the sequence numbers, but cannot determine the proper file
      names, so these must be fixed by hand.
    </p><p>
      DocMaker must invent file names for its references to the image files
      because the original file names are unavailable. The names that DocMaker
      uses are composed from the chapter or appendix name and the image
      sequence number. If the book contained a single main content file, it
      is just a matter of finding the <tt class="sgmltag-element">imagedata</tt> elements
      in the DocBook XML files and renaming the image file with the same
      sequence number to match the value of the
      <tt class="sgmltag-attribute">fileref</tt> attribute. For example,
      the value of the <tt class="sgmltag-attribute">fileref</tt> attribute
      might be <tt class="sgmltag-attvalue">images/concepts-34.gif</tt>
      (meaning the &ldquo;<span class="quote">Concepts</span>&rdquo; chapter and the thirty-fourth image
      that appeared in the file containing that chapter), so you should locate
      the image file with sequence number <tt class="literal">34</tt> and rename
      it to <tt class="filename">concepts-34.gif</tt>. If the book contained more
      than one main content file, you may have more than one image file with
      the same sequence number and you must ensure both that the sequence
      numbers match and that the original <span class="application">FrameMaker</span>
      file, whose name is used in the name of the image file, contained the
      chapter whose name is used in the
      <tt class="sgmltag-attribute">fileref</tt> attribute reference.
    </p><p>
      This process is relatively simple, but there is a possible cause of
      confusion. If a chapter was split over several files with sections
      in these file containing images, then the reference in the DocBook
      XML file may be ambiguous. In this case, the reference will use the
      chapter name and sequence number, but as there were several files in
      the chapter, the sequence number in the image files will have been
      repeated. For example,
      <tt class="sgmltag-attvalue">images/development-2.gif</tt> could
      refer to the second image in <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> of the original
      files that contributed content to the &ldquo;<span class="quote">Development</span>&rdquo;
      chapter; you may see this reference repeated more than once if more
      than one file contained two or more images. To resolve this, you will
      need to identify the section that contains the reference and then
      match that to the image file named after the file that contained that
      section; the sequence numbers will then match as before. However, you
      will need to assign new numbers and change the value of the
      <tt class="sgmltag-attribute">fileref</tt> attributes so that all
      these references are uniquely named. 
    </p><div class="note"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="2" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="../images/note.gif"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" colspan="2"><p>
        When renaming files, there is no need to keep the sequence numbers;
        these are just a convention used in the conversion process. You can
        rename the files to anything you like (you could base the name on the
        title of the figure), as long as you change the value of the
        <tt class="sgmltag-attribute">fileref</tt> attribute to match.
        You can also organize the image file in sub-folders of the
        <tt class="filename">images</tt> folder and, again, update the reference
        in the <tt class="sgmltag-attribute">fileref</tt> attribute.
      </p></td></tr></table></div><p>
      The following steps must be followed for each file in the
      <tt class="filename">dboutput/images</tt> folder.
    </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
          If the file extension is <tt class="filename">.wmf</tt> convert the
          file to <span class="acronym">SVG</span> format with an extension of
          <tt class="filename">.svg</tt> (see above).
        </p><p>
          You can keep the <span class="acronym">WMF</span> format file if you wish
          to use it as the <span class="emphasis"><em>master</em></span> copy of the graphic,
          but if you change it, you must update the <span class="acronym">SVG</span>
          file.
        </p></li><li><p>
          View the image file and then locate the matching figure in your
          original <span class="application">FrameMaker</span> document. The
          exported graphic files have the same name as the original document
          file and an additional sequence number. This should make it easier
          to locate. Once located, note the figure title.
        </p></li><li><p>
          Open the DocBook <span class="acronym">XML</span> file in
          <tt class="filename">dboutput</tt> for the chapter or appendix that
          contains the figure and locate the <tt class="sgmltag-element">figure</tt>
          element that contains the reference to the graphic file. The file
          name will be different, so use the figure title that you noted in
          the previous step to identify the correct <tt class="sgmltag-element">figure</tt>
          element.
        </p><p>
          For figures without titles, you will have to locate the corresponding
          <tt class="sgmltag-element">informalfigure</tt> element. As there is no title, use
          the sequence number and the context as a guide.
        </p></li><li><p>
          Within the <tt class="sgmltag-element">figure</tt> element you will see an
          <tt class="sgmltag-element">imagedata</tt> element containing a reference
          to an image file. Note the value of this
          <tt class="sgmltag-attribute">fileref</tt> attribute. If the
          extension on the file name is <tt class="filename">.gif</tt>, but the
          graphic file is in <span class="acronym">SVG</span> format, change the
          extension to <tt class="filename">.svg</tt> and change the value of
          the <tt class="sgmltag-attribute">format</tt> attribute to
          <tt class="sgmltag-attvalue">SVG</tt>.
        </p></li><li><p>
          Rename the graphic file to match the name in the
          <tt class="sgmltag-attribute">fileref</tt> attribute. Note,
          however, that if the original document file contained only
          sections and no chapter or appendix title, that you may need to
          assign a new sequence number as described above.

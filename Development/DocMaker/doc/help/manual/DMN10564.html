    checking to ensure that the documents need to be rendered again. There is
    no need, for example, to render a document again if the content has not
    changed. DocMaker detects these changes by comparing the modification time
    stamps of your content files to the modification time stamps of the output
    files created when the content was last rendered. This can save
    considerable time when you are working on one book in a large group of
    books. The first time you perform a rendering operation such as
    <tt class="option">generate-pdf</tt>, all of the PDF documents are created for
    all of the books. If you change one book and run
    <tt class="option">generate-pdf</tt> again, only the book you changed will be
    rendered to a new PDF document, as all of the other PDF documents are
    already up to date.</p><p>This dependency checking is limited in two ways: dependencies on
    resource files are not calculated, and dependencies caused by XML
    inclusions are only calculated from the book files. If your book file
    includes a chapter file and you change the chapter file, DocMaker will
    render your book again, as the content has probably changed. However, if a
    book file includes a chapter file and that chapter file includes a section
    file, a change to the section file will not be detected and DocMaker will
    not render the book again. Similarly, changes to resources such as image
    files are not detected. Most C&uacute;ram books include few images and are
    organized as book files that include only chapter files, so this
    limitation is not too severe.</p><p>If you find that DocMaker has not detected a change and has not
    rendered a document as expected, then you can run the
    <tt class="option">clean</tt> target to remove the old generated output and run
    the rendering process again, or you can update the time stamp on the
    relevant book file. If you have a large number of books in a group, the
    latter option will save you time. You may have a utility like the
    <span><b class="command">touch</b></span> command available to update the time stamp of the
    book file, or you can just open the book file in an editor and save it
    again. Some editors do not save the file if you have not changed it, so
    making a simple change and then reversing that change (for example, typing
    a character and then deleting it again) before saving the file is usually
    sufficient to update the modification time stamp. Once this is done,
    DocMaker should detect the change and render your document again.</p></div></div><div class="footer"><p class="copyright">Licensed Materials - Property of IBM Corp, IBM Corporation and other(s) 1999,2012.

    formats, but it must first be able to locate that content and identify the
    purpose of each file. A rigid folder structure is imposed and it must be
    followed for DocMaker to work correctly.</p><p>DocMaker only supports one style of document: a book. Each book can
    have chapters and appendices and these can be subdivided into sections.
    Depending on the output format chosen, DocMaker will manage the creation
    of a table of contents and the addition of cover pages, logos, search
    indexes and other boilerplate content. DocMaker will render all of the
    books it finds in a single invocation, so they must be organized in a
    manner that lets DocMaker identify the content that belongs to each
    book.</p><p>All books in a group of books that are to be rendered together are
    located below a folder called the <i class="firstterm">document root
    folder</i>. This folder can be located anywhere and given any
    name. You can create more than one document root folder if you wish to
    maintain several separate book groups, each is entirely independent of the
    other. For example, you could use <tt class="filename">C:\Books</tt> as your
    document root folder.</p><p>The document root folder must contain one sub-folder for each book
    in the group. These are called the <i class="firstterm">book folders</i>.
    Even if you only have one book, it must still be located in a book folder.
    For example, you might place your user manual in the
    <tt class="filename">C:\Books\UserManual</tt> folder. You can have as many of
    these book folders as you require, one for each book. You can use any
    folder names you want except the name &ldquo;<span class="quote">doc</span>&rdquo;, as DocMaker will
    create a <tt class="filename">doc</tt> folder within the document root folder
    to contain all of the rendered output and this would overwrite your book
    folder of the same name.</p></div></div><div class="footer"><p class="copyright">Licensed Materials - Property of IBM Corp, IBM Corporation and other(s) 1999,2012.

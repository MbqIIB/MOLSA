    elements of the document <span class="emphasis"><em>mean</em></span> and not how they should
    look. In <a href="DMN10041.html#DMN1005C" title="Example:&nbsp;A Simple DocBook Document">the example, <i>A Simple DocBook Document</i></a>, the
    author has only indicated the structure of the document: a book with a
    chapter, sections, paragraphs, titles, etc.; some of the text is quoted
    and some is emphasized. There is no indication that the sections should be
    numbered, that the book's title should be on a separate page, that the
    paragraph should be spaced a certain distance from the section title, or
    that double or single quotation marks should be used. These are not the
    author's priorities. After all, the author is probably not a graphic
    designer or typographer skilled in these matters, rather a person with
    knowledge about the content of the document.</p><p>While authors may wonder why such emphasis is placed on structure
    and content and not on how the document looks, the benefits soon become
    apparent: once a document has been written and all its structure and
    content clearly identified: it is possible to impose
    <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> look (or even feel or sound) required. A
    conversion program can examine the document and clearly identify its
    structure. Text can be examined and words that should be emphasized,
    quoted, or considered in other ways, can be handled appropriately.</p><p>When authors are finished defining the content of documents, they
    are finished with the documents. All further work is performed by
    processing the document automatically to produce the required output
    format or formats. This final step is called &ldquo;<span class="quote">rendering</span>&rdquo;. The
    same document could be printed as a standard paper manual, provided in a
    &ldquo;<span class="quote">large print</span>&rdquo; format, distributed in an electronic format
    such as PDF or HTML, converted to speech by a computer, printed in
    Braille, or even produced in all these formats simultaneously. This is
    possible because the authors have clearly identified each element of the
    document. Rather than indicating that text should be in italics, they have
    indicated that it should be &ldquo;<span class="quote">emphasized</span>&rdquo;. For a printed
    manual this may indeed result in the use of an italic typeface, but for an
    audio translation, it might mean use a higher-pitched or louder
    voice.</p><p>Using DocBook markup, the time-consuming process of document
    conversion and rendering can be entirely automated. As the format is open
    and in plain text, it is easy to integrate into source-code control
    systems and can be edited concurrently by multiple authors. The manual
    editing of repetitive documentation, such as lists of error messages, can
    be replaced by automatic document generation.</p><p>Authors are required to pay more attention to document structure and
    the meaning of the content, but are freed from the requirement to consider
    the formatting. The resulting flexibility and automation allowed by the
    DocBook XML format more than compensates for this increased &ldquo;<span class="quote">duty of
    care</span>&rdquo;.</p></div></div><div class="footer"><p class="copyright">Licensed Materials - Property of IBM Corp, IBM Corporation and other(s) 1999,2012.

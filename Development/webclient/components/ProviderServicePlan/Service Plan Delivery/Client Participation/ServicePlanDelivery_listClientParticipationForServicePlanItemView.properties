Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a list of the client participation for a plan item. The number of hours on a given date that a plan participant spends on an activity defined by a plan item. This information is used to ensure that the client is meeting the required participation commitments. If the client does not meet these commitments, then a sanction may be applied. This is dependent on the rules associated with the program for which the sanction applies. Participation can only be recorded for plan items which are in progress or completed.

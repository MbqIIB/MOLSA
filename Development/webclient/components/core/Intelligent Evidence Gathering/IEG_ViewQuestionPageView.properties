Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a question page. A question page has two components: a question group and possibly a precondition. Thus pages consist of a set of logically related questions and labels with some logic controlling whether or not those questions and labels should be presented to the user. Question pages allow question groups to be reused between scripts. It is be possible to relate two pages in a parent-child manner. Pages structured as children of a common parent page will only be visible if their own precondition and those of all of its antecedents are met at script execution time.

Cluster.Title.Loopsize=Loop size
Cluster.Title.Loopsize.Help=Loop size can contain an expression. At script execution time the loop size expression, if defined, is evaluated to determine the number of times, if any, the questions and labels of the associated question group are repeated on the page. Loop size also determines the number of times the child pages of this page are repeatedly presented to the user. For example, a single question group could relate to the details of a single child, but perhaps the script should collect details for all children in the household; in this case, the loop size should evaluate the number of children in the household. Click the link to access the formula helper to aid in the creation of the loop size. Loop size is specified as an expression and can contain brackets, the conjunctions AND and OR, constant values, question IDs and RDO data item names.

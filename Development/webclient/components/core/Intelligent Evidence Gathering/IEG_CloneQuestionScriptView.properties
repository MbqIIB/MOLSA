Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to clone a question script. This functionality allows the creation of similar question scripts without the need to completely re-enter the question script details. It should be noted that this clone facility performs a shallow clone. Only the question pages and the preconditions etc. are cloned, the question groups are not. Therefore if changes are made to the question groups in the cloned question script, the changes will be reflected in the original script.

Page.Title = Clone Question Script:

Field.Label.NewScriptID=New Script ID
Field.Label.NewScriptID.Help=ID of the new question script which will be a clone of the existing question script. The script ID must be unique from all other script IDs.

Field.Label.NewScriptName=New Script Name
Field.Label.NewScriptName.Help=Name of the new question script.

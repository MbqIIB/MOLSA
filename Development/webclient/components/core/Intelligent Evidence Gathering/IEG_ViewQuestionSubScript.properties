Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a question subscript for an IEG script. Question subscripts are question scripts themselves. Question scripts are sets of question pages which are presented to the user by the IEG infrastructure at script execution time. The aim of a question script is to guide a user or participant through a set of questions in a logical and intelligent manner, resulting in an appropriate set of data being collected. A combination of a tree-view and html frames are used to navigate through the creation and maintenance of question scripts.

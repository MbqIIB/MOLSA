Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create a precondition for a question page. Preconditions are evaluated at script execution time to determine whether or not that question page should be presented to the user. If the precondition for a page is not met, none of that page's child pages will be considered as being part of that particular script execution. This means that for a page to be displayed its own precondition and those of all of its antecedents will have to be met at script execution time.

ActionControl.Label.Save=Save
ActionControl.Label.Save.Help=The Save action creates a new precondition from the information entered on the page.
ActionControl.Label.Cancel=Cancel
ActionControl.Label.Cancel.Help=The Cancel action dismisses the page without the precondition being created.

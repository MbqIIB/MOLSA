Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create an applied deduction for a variable amount. A variable amount is a percentage that is deducted from a participant's benefit payment. For example, a 10% state defined income tax can be deducted from a participant's unemployment insurance payments. Variable deductions can be created against an individual case component or against all components for the case. A variable deduction that is created against a specific component will only be deducted from the part of the benefit payment issued in respect of that single component. If a component is not specified and there is only one nominee on the case, the deduction is automatically deducted from the first component with a sufficient benefit amount to process the full deduction. If there is more than one nominee on the case, the deduction is split per nominee to cover the total deduction percentage. For example, John Smith receives one benefit component and Linda Smith receives another benefit component for a case. The percentage deduction to be deducted from the benefit payment is 20%. When payments are generated in respect of the components, 20% is deducted from the payment issued to John Smith and 20% is deducted from the payment issued to Linda Smith.
